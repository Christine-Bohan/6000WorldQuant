NID intends to liquidate on or before March 31, 2023. The fund will not declare its regular monthly income distribution in March 2023 and expects to include any remaining undistributed net investment income with the fund’s final liquidating distribution. The fund anticipates making its final liquidating distribution on or about March 31, 2023. In connection with the liquidation, the fund anticipates providing an estimate of the amount of tax-exempt income included as part of the fund’s liquidating distribution. The final tax character of all distributions paid in 2023 will be reported to shareholders on Form 1099-DIV, which will be sent out in early 2024.

Each fund intends to distribute all or substantially all of its net investment income through its regular monthly distribution and to distribute realized capital gains at least annually. In any monthly period, in order to maintain its level distribution amount, each fund may pay out more or less than its net investment income during the period. As a result, regular distributions throughout the year are expected to include net investment income and potentially a return of capital and/or capital gains for tax purposes. If a distribution includes anything other than net investment income, the fund provides a notice of the best estimate of its distribution sources at the time of the distribution which may be viewed at www.nuveen.com/CEFdistributions. These estimates may not match the final tax characterization (for the full year’s distributions) contained in shareholders’ 1099-DIV forms after the end of the year.You should not draw any conclusions about the Fund’s investment performance from the amount of the distribution. A return of capital is a non-taxable distribution of a portion of a Fund’s capital. A distribution including return of capital does not necessarily reflect a Fund’s investment performance and should not be confused with ""yield"" or ""income.""Record DateMarch 15, 2023Ex-Dividend DateMarch 14, 2023Payable DateApril 3, 2023Monthly Distribution Per ShareChange FromTickerExchangeFund NameAmountPrevious MonthFloating RateNSLNYSENuveen Senior Income Fund$0.0435-JFRNYSENuveen Floating Rate Income Fund$0.0745-JRONYSENuveen Floating Rate Income Opportunity Fund$0.0740-JSDNYSENuveen Short Duration Credit Opportunities Fund$0.1110-JQCNYSENuveen Credit Strategies Income Fund$0.0475-Mortgage-Backed SecuritiesJMMNYSENuveen Multi-Market Income Fund$0.0275-JLSNYSENuveen Mortgage and Income Fund$0.1160-Global High Yield DebtJGHNYSENuveen Global High Income Fund$0.1035-Monthly Managed DistributionsThe goal of each fund’s managed distribution program is to provide shareholders relatively consistent and predictable cash flow by systematically converting expected long-term return potential into regular distributions. Historical distribution sources have included net investment income, realized gains and return of capital. If a distribution includes anything other than net investment income, the fund provides a notice of the best estimate of its distribution sources at that time which may be viewed at www.nuveen.com/CEFdistributions. These estimates may not match the final tax characterization contained in shareholders’ 1099-DIV forms after the end of the year.Under a Managed Distribution policy, Nuveen closed-end funds seek to maintain a stable regular distribution amount that, over the long term, matches the fund’s total distributions paid to its total return. Investors should not draw any conclusions about a fund’s past or future investment performance from its current distribution rate or from the terms of its Managed Distribution Policy.Actual returns likely will differ from projected long-term returns, (and therefore a fund’s distribution rate, also), at least over shorter time periods. Over a specific timeframe, a fund’s net asset value will increase (if returns exceed distributions), or decrease (if distributions exceed returns), by the difference between actual returns and total distributions.A return of capital is a non-taxable distribution of a portion of the fund’s capital. When a fund’s returns exceed distributions, return of capital may represent portfolio gains earned, but not realized as a taxable capital gain. In periods when a fund’s returns fall short of distributions, it will represent a portion of the investors’ original principal unless the shortfall is offset during other time periods over the life of the investment (previous or subsequent) when the fund’s total return exceeds distributions.For additional information about managed distributions, please see Understanding Managed Distributions.The following dates apply to today's declarations:Record DateMarch 15, 2023Ex-Dividend DateMarch 14, 2023Payable DateApril 3, 2023Monthly Distribution Per ShareChange FromTickerExchangeFund NameAmountPrevious MonthReal AssetsJRINYSENuveen Real Asset Income and Growth Fund$0.0870-$0.0095National MunicipalNDMONYSENuveen Dynamic Municipal Opportunities Fund$0.0620-$0.0145Taxable Fixed Income-Multi-SectorNPCTNYSENuveen Core Plus Impact Fund$0.0830-$0.0200Information regarding each fund’s last 19(a) Distribution Notice (as of January 31, 2023) is also included below.

For all funds, it is estimated that the funds have distributed more than their income and net realized capital gains; therefore, a portion of their distributions may be (and is shown below as being estimated to be) a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the money that you invested in the Fund is paid back to you.

2023-04-04,"A downtrend has been apparent in Aileron Therapeutics, Inc. (ALRN) lately. While the stock has lost 10.3% over the past week, it could witness a trend reversal as a hammer chart pattern was formed in its last trading session. This could mean that the bulls have been able to counteract the bears to help the stock find support.The formation of a hammer pattern is considered a technical indication of nearing a bottom with likely subsiding of selling pressure. But this is not the only factor that makes a bullish case for the stock. On the fundamental side, strong agreement among Wall Street analysts in raising earnings estimates for this company enhances its prospects of a trend reversal.1-month candlestick chart for ALRNUnderstanding Hammer Chart and the Technique to Trade ItThis is one of the popular price patterns in candlestick charting. A minor difference between the opening and closing prices forms a small candle body, and a higher difference between the low of the day and the open or close forms a long lower wick (or vertical line). The length of the lower wick being at least twice the length of the real body, the candle resembles a 'hammer.'In simple terms, during a downtrend, with bears having absolute control, a stock usually opens lower compared to the previous day's close, and again closes lower. On the day the hammer pattern is formed, maintaining the downtrend, the stock makes a new low. However, after eventually finding support at the low of the day, some amount of buying interest emerges, pushing the stock up to close the session near or slightly above its opening price.When it occurs at the bottom of a downtrend, this pattern signals that the bears might have lost control over the price. And, the success of bulls in stopping the price from falling further indicates a potential trend reversal.Hammer candles can occur on any timeframe -- such as one-minute, daily, weekly -- and are utilized by both short-term as well as long-term investors.Story continuesLike every technical indicator, the hammer chart pattern has its limitations. Particularly, as the strength of a hammer depends on its placement on the chart, it should always be used in conjunction with other bullish indicators.Here's What Increases the Odds of a Turnaround for ALRNThere has been an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions for ALRN lately, which can certainly be considered a bullish indicator on the fundamental side. That's because a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term.The consensus EPS estimate for the current year has increased 56.3% over the last 30 days. This means that the Wall Street analysts covering ALRN are majorly in agreement about the company's potential to report better earnings than what they predicted earlier.If this is not enough, you should note that ALRN currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises. And stocks carrying a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 usually outperform the market. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>Moreover, the Zacks Rank has proven to be an excellent timing indicator, helping investors identify precisely when a company's prospects are beginning to improve. So, for the shares of Aileron Therapeutics, Inc. a Zacks Rank of 2 is a more conclusive fundamental indication of a potential turnaround.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

2023-04-11,"The higher product cost, a tight labor market and supply-chain issues are some of the headwinds that players in the Zacks Retail - Apparel And Shoes industry have been encountering. These, along with the geopolitical turbulence due to the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, have been making things tough for companies. The demand for apparel has softened as consumers are spending more on necessities. Rising prices have squeezed consumers’ disposable income.To navigate troubled waters, industry participants have been directing resources toward digital platforms, accelerating fleet optimization and augmenting the supply chain. Retailers have been focusing on the superior product strategy, the advancement of omnichannel capabilities, prudent capital investments and greater customer reach. Backed by these initiatives, companies like Tapestry, Inc. TPR, American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. AEO, Urban Outfitters, Inc. URBN and Boot Barn Holdings, Inc. BOOT are better placed.About the IndustryThe Zacks Retail - Apparel And Shoes industry comprises companies that offer apparel, footwear, accessories, intimates and beauty products, as well as fitness and lifestyle products for use in yoga, training and sports under various brands in domestic and international markets. Quite a few players offer bag collections, including business cases, computer bags and backpacks, leather goods, such as wallets, card cases, travel organizers and belts, and watches, sunglasses, fragrances and ready-to-wear as well as cold-weather accessories. Markedly, companies showcase products to customers directly through their branded retail stores, mobile applications, catalogs and websites. Some industry participants also provide products via department stores, specialty retailers, third-party e-commerce sites and franchisees who operate brand-dedicated stores.4 Key Trends to Watch in the Retail - Apparel And Shoes IndustryPressure on Margins to Linger: The industry is quite fragmented, with companies vying for a bigger slice of the pie on attributes such as price, products and speed to market. To address these, a significant number of players in the industry have been investing in strengthening their digital ecosystem and delivery capabilities. While these endeavors bolster sales, they entail high costs. Apart from these, higher marketing, advertising and other store-related expenses might compress margins. Of late, the industry participants have been dealing with product cost inflation, a tight labor market and supply-chain issues. Nonetheless, companies have been focusing on undertaking initiatives to mitigate cost-related challenges. These include streamlining operational structures, optimizing supply networks and adopting effective pricing policies.Story continuesSoft Consumer Activity May Hit Revenues: Elevating prices and geopolitical concerns continue to pose a threat to consumer spending activity. Undoubtedly, the industry’s prospects are correlated with the purchasing power of consumers. However, higher gasoline and food prices have been discomforting family budgets. Consequently, the demand for apparel has softened. Per the Commerce Department, U.S. retail and food services sales in February declined 0.4% sequentially. Sales at clothing & clothing accessories outlets fell 0.8% on a month-on-month basis. Industry experts cited that any deterioration in macroeconomic conditions will hurt consumer confidence and, in turn, spending activity.Brand Enhancement, Capital Discipline: Industry participants have been focusing on deepening engagements with consumers, creating innovative and compelling products and enhancing digital and data analytics capabilities. The launch of newer styles, customization options and refreshed store environments enable them to woo shoppers. Efforts to enhance the brand portfolio via marketing strategies, buyouts, innovations and alliances are likely to keep supporting players in the space. The companies have been taking steps to strengthen their financial position. They have been making every move, from managing the inventory and closing underperforming stores to optimizing capital expenditures and enhancing operational efficiency.Diversification & Digitization Key to Growth: With the change in consumer shopping patterns and behavior, industry participants have been playing dual in-store and online roles. They are building an omnichannel, coming up with loyalty and marketing programs, enhancing the supply chain and providing faster delivery options, be it doorstep delivery, curbside pickup or buy online and pick up at a store, which are worth mentioning. Simultaneously, companies are investing in renovation, improved checkouts and mobile point-of-sale capabilities to keep stores relevant. Keeping in mind consumers’ product preferences and growing inclination toward online shopping, companies have been replenishing shelves with in-demand merchandise and ramping up investments in digitization.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak ProspectsThe Zacks Retail - Apparel And Shoes industry is a group within the broader Zacks Retail – Wholesale sector.

2023-04-16,"In this article, we will take a look at the top 10 luxury clothing stocks to buy. To see more such companies, go directly to Top 5 Luxury Clothing Stocks to Buy.The luxury goods market is famous for staying resilient and strong during recessionary environments. That’s because the rich and wealthy are usually the last to feel the real effects of rising inflation. Last year, when the broader turmoil in the stock market was crushing almost every other company, French luxury giant LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (EPA:MC) was posting strong sales growth. During the company’s third quarter earnings call, answering a question about how the company was able to manage to outperform despite the difficult odds, LVMH’s CFO Jean-Jacques Guiony  very realistically pointed to a fact that explains the strength of the luxury goods market even when things start to go south:“Luxury is not a proxy for the general economy. We end up selling to affluent people and they have a behavior on their own, which is not necessarily totally aligned with economics.”During the last quarter of 2022, LVMH, along with some other luxury companies, saw a slowdown, mainly driven by COVID-19 outbreaks in China. LVMH’s fashion and leather goods division posted organic sales growth of 10% during the period, which the company says was the slowest growth seen during 2022. However, the company said it started to see sales rebound in January 2023 after China reopened its economy. Jean-Jacques Guiony  said the company’s performance in China had  “recovered very significantly” in January and that “China has actually turned the page on the disruption of the pandemic.”How Does Luxury Business Remain Resilient Despite Inflation?Luxury companies like PVH Corp. (NYSE:PVH), Tapestry, Inc. (NYSE:TPR) and Capri Holdings Limited (NYSE:CPRI) aren’t totally immune to the economic realities, however. For example, LVMH’s chief Bernard Arnault said earlier this year that the company was “vigilant to current uncertainties.” But what makes the luxury sector strong in the face of global economic challenges is its ability to transfer rising costs to consumers. A December 2022 report from Financial Times says the prices of core handbags from Chanel and Louis Vuitton have jumped about 20% over the past two years, with more price hikes expected, especially in Europe. The report cited Citi luxury analyst Thomas Chauvet, who estimates that prices could rise by another 15% in 2023 in Europe and in the mid-single digits in the US and China.Story continuesAnother growth catalyst for the luxury sector comes from the emerging markets where wealth and consumers’ appetite to buy and boast luxury items keep increasing. Bain estimates that sales in the sector are expected to increase by a whopping 60% between 2022 and 2030, driven by the increase in luxury consumers from India, Mexico, South Korea and south-east Asia.The Benefits of Having The Top 1% As CustomersGlobal wealth increase that seems to buoy the top 1% also explains the robust growth of the luxury goods market. Bloomberg in a reported quoted data from Boston Consulting Group, which says that global wealth jumped 10.6% (adding $26 trillion) in 2021, clocking in the fastest rate in more than a decade. The coronavirus crisis also fueled consumer spending in the luxury goods market. The Bloomberg report cited Gachoucha Kretz, associate marketing professor at business school HEC Paris, who pointed to a trend he calls “revenge shopping” after the pandemic, in which consumers spend lavishly on the assumption that “life is short” and “‘I might as well enjoy today since I don’t know what’s going to happen tomorrow.’”In this backdrop, it’s necessary to take a look at the top luxury clothing companies in which hedge funds are investing.Luxury Clothing Stocks to BuySorbis/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyFor this article, we scanned the holdings of 943 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey and picked top 10 companies that make luxury clothing products.

Price and EPS SurpriseTyler Technologies, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseTyler Technologies, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Tyler Technologies, Inc.

It has been continuously advancing its core software applications and expanding the complementary product and service portfolios to fulfill the changing needs of customers and respond to technological advancements.In addition, the company’s closed acquisitions over the past 12 months are anticipated to have brought incremental revenues during the quarter under review. TYL bought three businesses in the last 12 months, namely US eDirect, Quatred and Rapid.However, the ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical issues might have disrupted Tyler’s business during the period in discussion. Inflationary pressures might have led public sector entities to delay procurement processes and lengthen sales cycles, which could have hurt Tyler’s revenues in the quarter under review.

QuoteKey Factors to NoteChurch & Dwight has been gaining from its robust acquisitions and emphasis on sound innovation. The company continues to profit from strong consumer demand. Church & Dwight has been resorting to incremental pricing across its portfolio to counter rising costs.For the first quarter of 2023, the company expects roughly 4% increase in reported sales and 1% increase in organic sales growth. In its last earnings call, management highlighted that solid consumption in several businesses during 2022 has offset the slowdown across discretionary brands, including Waterpik and Flawless and reduced consumption growth in the vitamin category. Moreover, management expects gross margin expansion in the first quarter, partly offset by higher marketing and SG&A spending.The company expects first-quarter adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of approximately 75 cents per share, down 10% from the year-ago quarter’s adjusted EPS.

2023-04-25,"Ongoing savings achieved since 2018 exceeded projections, reducing the overall Kansas rate increase request by more than 37%KANSAS CITY, Mo., April 25, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today Evergy (NASDAQ: EVRG) filed a request and supporting documentation with the Kansas Corporation Commission to recover investments made to improve service to customers with a more reliable and resilient power grid and updated customer service systems. This is the first base rate review Evergy has requested in five years.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230424005982/en/Regional changes in electricity rates (Graphic: Business Wire)Evergy was formed in 2018 by the merger of Westar Energy and Great Plains Energy. As part of the merger approval, Evergy agreed to keep the energy company local by maintaining its Kansas headquarters in Topeka and continuing to invest millions annually in local community organizations and charities throughout its Kansas service area. Evergy also committed to significantly reduce the operating costs of the combined company, to pass those savings on to customers and not to ask for an increase to base rates for five years. Evergy has kept all of those commitments.For the Evergy Kansas Central service area, the company is requesting a net revenue increase of $204 million or a 9.77% overall rate increase — reflecting a reduction of nearly $89 million in operating costs and other billing line items. If the full request is approved, the monthly bill increase for an average residential customer would be about $14.24. Evergy Kansas Central includes approximately 736,000 customers in Topeka, Pittsburg, Wichita, Hutchinson and other communities in the eastern third of the state. In the Evergy Kansas Metro service area, the company is requesting a net revenue increase of $14 million or a 1.95% overall rate increase — reflecting a reduction of nearly $41 million in operating costs and other billing line items. If the full request is approved, the monthly bill increase for an average residential customer would be about $3.47. Evergy Kansas Metro includes approximately 273,000 customers in Lenexa, Overland Park and other communities near the Kansas City metro area.Story continues""We formed Evergy with a focus of reducing costs and making rates more affordable and competitive. Over the past five years, we have made significant progress towards that goal. Since 2018, our Kansas customers have received $232 million in merger savings and bill credits,"" said David Campbell, Evergy president and chief executive officer. ""We’ve exceeded our targeted merger savings and shared them with customers. Now, we are seeking to recover investments made to improve the electric grid and build a smarter, more reliable energy future for our Kansas customers.""This rate review is the first that Evergy has requested in Kansas since the creation of the company in 2018. Offsetting steep inflation in Kansas and the US economy, operational cost savings and merger efficiencies have allowed Evergy to maintain flat rates for Evergy’s Kansas customers over the last five years. Since 2017, overall rates for Evergy Kansas customers have increased just 0.1% and residential rates have decreased 2.5%. During the same time period, other electric utility rates in states surrounding Kansas have increased nearly 13% and the Consumer Price Index (CPI) has increased 20%. In addition, since the merger, Evergy has delivered $232 million in merger savings and bill credits to Kansas customers.""The merger has helped stabilize prices despite historically high inflation. We have achieved nearly $1 billion in cost savings and efficiencies as a combined company since the merger. This achievement has helped us keep rates flat and has reduced our requested increase for investments made over the last five years by more than 37%,"" said Campbell. ""From residential customers to large businesses, we know how important it is to keep electricity affordable especially in the wake of record inflation.""The most significant driver of the rate increase request relates to infrastructure improvement aimed at enhancing reliability and resiliency. While Evergy has a track record of solid performance, as the electric system ages, modern upgrades are needed to maintain and improve reliability. Evergy has made significant improvements over the past several years focused on the power grid, with a goal of making it more resistant to outages from severe weather and improving resiliency to restore power faster when outages occur. Some of those improvements include rebuilding aging power lines and equipment and adding advanced automation technology that can reduce the impact of power outages by isolating the cause of the outage more quickly. In addition, Evergy is leveraging data analytics to improve its ability to identify areas at risk for outages, allowing it to target maintenance and replacement work, driving reduced outages and operating costs.""A resilient, reliable power grid is critical for our customers. A modern power grid deploys automation to run more efficiently and effectively and must be hardened and maintained against physical threats, including the extremes of Kansas weather, and equipped with secure communication devices that help prevent and shorten power outages,"" Campbell said. ""Five years after creating Evergy, we remain local and invested in the communities we serve. We have reduced our operating costs, our rates are more competitive, our power generation is more sustainable, and our service is more resilient.""As part of the rate review, Evergy has requested an increased allowance for depreciation of investments to ensure that recovery of costs associated with an asset is aligned with the useful lives of those assets and the customers who benefit. Evergy has also asked to include funding for expected dismantlement costs to provide for appropriate decommissioning of power plants upon retirement.This rate increase request includes investments made to replace legacy customer service systems with new, shared systems that provide for greater efficiency and that enable customer experience enhancements. This single platform enabled us to increase the number and types of online and self-service transactions either on the phone or online. Evergy has also expanded and improved payment capabilities, start and stop service, outage management capabilities, outage and billing notifications and energy management tools. In September 2022, Evergy launched a mobile app that includes often-used capabilities from the website.The Evergy Kansas Central request includes recovery of its share of costs of IT systems shared across all Evergy customers. These shared systems are a key enabler of merger efficiencies that have resulted in savings of more than $110 million annually for Evergy Kansas Central customers, far exceeding the cost included in the request. Resolution of legacy Evergy Kansas Central items that constitute nearly $56 million of the rate increase request include the expiration of wholesale energy contracts which had contributed to lower rates during the contract term and managing the previously established end to a corporate owned life insurance program initiated in 1985.Kansas rate requests follow an 8-month process before the Kansas Corporation Commission (KCC). New rates will become effective in December 2023. As part of the process, Evergy must demonstrate that its request is warranted, and the supporting costs are prudent. Evergy and other interested parties representing the Commission and consumers will submit and exchange information through briefs and filings available on the KCC website.About Evergy, Inc.Evergy, Inc.

2023-04-28,"Avnet AVT is slated to report its third-quarter fiscal 2023 results on May 3 after market close.The company's earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 15.5%.Avnet estimates fiscal third-quarter revenues in the range of $6.15-$6.45 billion (the midpoint being $6.30 billion). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $6.27 billion, suggesting a decrease of 3.3% from the year-ago quarter's reported figure.This Phoenix, AZ-based tech company projects adjusted earnings in the band of $1.75-$1.85 per share (the midpoint being $1.80). The consensus mark for the bottom line stands at $1.78 per share, indicating a 17.2% year-over-year surge.Our estimates for Avnet’s third-quarter revenues and non-GAAP earnings stand at $6.18 billion and $1.75 per share, respectively.Let’s see how things have shaped up before the upcoming announcement.Avnet, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseAvnet, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseAvnet, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Avnet, Inc. QuoteFactors to NoteAvnet's fiscal third-quarter results are likely to reflect high-margin expansion for its electronic components. Specifically, America and the EMEA are anticipated to have registered higher revenues, which typically generate high margins. This might have boosted AVT’s profitability in the to-be-reported quarter.With Farnell becoming the exclusive licensed distributor of the Raspberry Pi single-board computer, Avnet might have witnessed the continued engagement of existing customers and new customer acquisitions in the quarter to be reported. However, currency fluctuations are likely to have impacted the Farnell business in the third quarter.The company expects to witness solid demand across its Automotive, Transportation and Industrial segments. However, a slowdown in Asia is likely to have more than offset the benefits of the aforementioned factors. Moreover, Avnet’s overall third-quarter performance is expected to have been negatively impacted by constraints in product availability and pricing pressure.Story continuesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Electronic Component segment's revenues is pegged at $5.86 billion, suggesting a decrease of 2.7% year over year. The consensus mark for the Premier Farnell division's sales stands at $409 million, indicating a year-over-year decline of 12.8%.Headwinds related to the persistent inflation and persistent disruptions from supply-chain constraints might have weighed on the company's top-and-bottom-line performance in the quarter to be reported.What Our Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Avnet this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. However, that’s not the case here.AVT carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) at present and has an Earnings ESP of -0.75%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Stocks With the Favorable CombinationPer our model, Skyworks Solutions SWKS, Garmin GRMN and Model N MODN have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases.Skyworks carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of +0.15%. The company is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2023 results on May 8. Its earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the preceding four quarters, with the average surprise being 1.9%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Skyworks’ second-quarter earnings stands at $2.02 per share, implying a year-over-year decline of 23.2%.

The company has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +5.79% at present. Garmin’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the trailing four quarters while missing the same on one occasion, the average surprise being a negative 7.3%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GRMN’s first-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.00 per share, suggesting a decline of 9.9% from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of $1.11.

2023-04-29,"Church & Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD) has announced that it will be increasing its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 1st of June to $0.2725. This takes the annual payment to 1.1% of the current stock price, which unfortunately is below what the industry is paying. Check out our latest analysis for Church & Dwight Church & Dwight's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsIt would be nice for the yield to be higher, but we should also check if higher levels of dividend payment would be sustainable. Based on the last payment, Church & Dwight was quite comfortably earning enough to cover the dividend. This indicates that quite a large proportion of earnings is being invested back into the business.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 116.6%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 31% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.historic-dividendChurch & Dwight Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $0.48 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $1.09. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 8.5% per annum over that time. The growth of the dividend has been pretty reliable, so we think this can offer investors some nice additional income in their portfolio.The Dividend Has Limited Growth PotentialThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. Let's not jump to conclusions as things might not be as good as they appear on the surface. Earnings per share has been sinking by 11% over the last five years. Such rapid declines definitely have the potential to constrain dividend payments if the trend continues into the future. It's not all bad news though, as the earnings are predicted to rise over the next 12 months - we would just be a bit cautious until this becomes a long term trend.Story continuesOur Thoughts On Church & Dwight's DividendOverall, it's great to see the dividend being raised and that it is still in a sustainable range. The earnings coverage is acceptable for now, but with earnings on the decline we would definitely keep an eye on the payout ratio. Taking all of this into consideration, the dividend looks viable moving forward, but investors should be mindful that the company has pushed the boundaries of sustainability in the past and may do so again.It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock.

2023-04-30,"Key InsightsIDEX's estimated fair value is US$232 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityWith US$206 share price, IDEX appears to be trading close to its estimated fair value The US$232 analyst price target for IEXis comparable to our estimate of fair value.Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of IDEX Corporation (NYSE:IEX) as an investment opportunity by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for IDEX The ModelWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$662.7mUS$712.4mUS$773.8mUS$859.0mUS$1.06bUS$1.16bUS$1.24bUS$1.32bUS$1.38bUS$1.43bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x8Analyst x9Analyst x4Analyst x3Analyst x1Est @ 9.79%Est @ 7.48%Est @ 5.85%Est @ 4.72%Est @ 3.92% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.2% US$612US$609US$611US$627US$712US$722US$717US$702US$679US$652(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$6.6bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.4b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.2%– 2.1%) = US$24bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$24b÷ ( 1 + 8.2%)10= US$11bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$18b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$206, the company appears about fair value at a 11% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at IDEX as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.031. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for IDEXStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Machinery market.OpportunityAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.Current share price is below our estimate of fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. For IDEX, we've compiled three relevant aspects you should assess:Financial Health: Does IEX have a healthy balance sheet?

By harnessing our unique competitive advantages and strong execution capabilities, we are confident in our outlook and are raising and narrowing our full year 2023 guidance. Turning to Slide 4. I wanted to provide an update on what we're seeing and what we expect over the course of 2023. Starting on the left in the current environment, hardware product orders were better than expected, down mid-single digit and backlog was more resilient with a book-to-bill of 1.0 in the first quarter.Our software businesses continue to see good growth benefiting from strong customer value propositions, driving double-digit growth in our SaaS revenue streams. While industry challenges remained in our Healthcare segment due to China, consumables growth in March reaffirmed recovery is underway. We expect momentum to continue and accelerate growth and profitability throughout 2023. Moving to the right-hand side of the slide, we are seeing traction on our new product launches, favorably aligned to secular drivers including Fluke's latest family of solar tools and Tektronix' leading power and electronic test systems, together with continued software strength and recovery in healthcare, we expect to sustain core growth in the second half. Combined with favorable pricing, cost savings and discrete productivity initiatives that span all segments, we expect over 75 basis points of margin expansion in the year.Lastly, we expect robust free cash flow growth again in 2023 which together with our very strong balance sheet, gives us confidence that our attractive M&A funnel will provide opportunities to enhance earnings and cash flow compounding in the future. Turning to Slide 5. We want to take a minute to remind you of all the work we've done to transform our portfolio and create focused segment strategies favorably aligned to a number of strong secular trends, has resulted in a more resilient Fortive with enduring growth and further margin expansion opportunities. As a result, today, we have a stronger collection of businesses with a more diversified end market mix and durable recurring revenue profile that includes leading healthcare and software franchises.Together with our enhanced innovation capabilities, we have focused our portfolio around multiyear megatrends, including automation, digitization, the electrification of everything and improving healthcare trends to name a few, all to reduce the overall cyclicality of our businesses and provide more tailwinds for growth by expanding into new markets. As a result of these megatrends, we see continued growth across our portfolio. including the more durable software and services businesses as well as the nonrecurring portion, given the sizable amount of backlog, some of our product businesses are working through, while continuing to see resilient demand. Finally, our portfolio quality is reinforced by the substantial improvements we've made in gross and operating profit, working capital and free cash flow as a percent of revenue, driven by the rigorous application of the Fortive Business System.Turning to Slide 6. FPS is a powerful mindset that makes continuous improvement a way of life at Fortive to drive deep engagement across our teams and hold them accountable for delivering on high expectations. With Kaizen activity accelerating, we saw significant results across the portfolio, including material improvement in delivery and past due backlog reduction in our hardware products businesses by improving planning and reducing part shortages with the Fortive material system. Board of software system deployment in our SaaS companies, including service channel, a current information is accelerating delivery of software features to customers, driving customer value and resulting in higher renewal rates and pricing gains. Our record gross margins in the first quarter were driven by a significant expansion of Kaizen events in the quarter, approximately double the number the prior year, setting us off for improved performance throughout the year.Turning to Slide 7. Fortive made sustainability a priority since its founding. It is inextricably linked to our company's shared purpose, values and business strategy, which you'll read more about in our upcoming 2023 sustainability report to be published in May. This year's report will further highlight how our commitment to sustainability is grounded in our culture of Kaizen, leveraging the power of FBS innovate products and services that enable more sustainable outcomes. We'll also hear how our team has strengthened our responsible sourcing initiatives, ensuring robust review of the labor and given rights practices across our supply chain and how our strong and inclusive culture is creating a community where everyone belongs, which is positively reflected in our latest employee engagement and inclusion, diversity and equity performance.In summary, we are accelerating progress towards a more sustainable future for Fortive and our customers as well as the environment and the communities in which we operate. We invite you to review our report next month. I'll now provide more details on each of our 3 segments, beginning with Intelligent Operating Solutions on Slide 8. IOS grew core revenue by 10% as our connected workflow strategy drove better-than-expected performance in the quarter. The segment saw a good growth in all regions with mid-single-digit growth in North America and Western Europe, and mid-40% growth in China, lapping prior year shutdowns. Solid core growth in each workflow and strong FPS driven execution resulted in 300 basis points of operating margin expansion, taking operating margins consistently above 30%.Looking at our performance drivers by workflow. In Connected Reliability, Fluke core revenues grew by low double digits with mid-single-digit orders growth in the quarter and point of sale remained positive in all regions. Fluke is benefiting from lean portfolio management, driving record revenue attainment and Fluke's new product launches, including the SMFT 1000 solar tester, which are benefiting from strong demand in the energy, renewables and electric vehicle markets. Elsewhere at Fluke, eMaint posted another record quarter with strong double-digit growth. We are seeing accelerated customer adoption of the X5 CMMS system with enhanced connected worker capability also closed the largest deal on record with a strategic enterprise customer.EHS revenues grew by mid-single digit with both Industrial Scientific and Intellect providing solid contributions. Industrial Scientific saw strength across all product lines, including iNET and orders growth outpaced sales driven by new product launches and cross-sell activity. Intelex posted another quarter of strong SaaS growth with low double-digit ARR growth. Moving to facilities and asset life cycle. We had high single-digit growth in the first quarter, driven by high single-digit SaaS revenue growth. Customers continue to shift larger projects to Gordian's job order contracting platform, while the wind down of endo-light programs are occurring, and the business model change and service channel lowered core growth, revenues exceeded expectations in as customers continue to seek more productive and digitized solutions to optimize their facilities management.piyaphun/Shutterstock.comFor example, a large worldwide retailer is migrating multiple manual processes to the real estate management platform at Acron and a large enterprise customer is leveraging service channels automation services to save hundreds of thousands of dollars of mismatched invoices. Turning now to Slide 9. Precision Technologies delivered another quarter of strong double-digit core revenue growth or revenues increased 14%, driven by a high single-digit growth in North America, low double-digit growth in Western Europe and high 30% growth in China. PT also delivered 190 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion with higher volume and strong price realization more than offsetting continued inflation and FX. Some highlights of the quarter included greater than 20% core revenue growth at Tektronix.Orders were better than expected, benefiting from bookings growth and electric vehicle testing programs. This and strong point of sale in all major regions drove double-digit growth across its product businesses in the first quarter, which continued to see good demand for recently introduced entry-level and mainstream stopes. Sensing Technologies reported low single-digit growth as expected, driven by another quarter of strong price realization across all businesses and continued broad strength of Ultra. Pacific Scientific EMC reported a second consecutive quarter of greater than 20% growth as the business continued to deploy FBS to improve operational performance. Moving now to Slide 10, in Advanced Healthcare Solutions. Core revenues are flat as the improvement in electric procedure volumes outside of China was offset by some supply chain challenges at Fluke Health Solutions and the expected headwinds in China elected procedures and the wind down in Russia.By major region, North America was up slightly, and Western Europe grew mid-single digits, offsetting a high single-digit decline in China. China elected procedures were covered in March, exiting the month at approximately 90% of normalized levels. Our outlook continues to assume that China electric procedures return to normalized levels in the second half of 2023. In the first quarter, AHS adjusted operating margins declined 260 basis points as a result of FX headwinds, supply chain challenges at Fluke Health, lowering contribution margins and higher-than-expected inflation. Some highlights in the quarter include we exited March with stronger ASP consumables growth, reaffirming recovery post COVID is underway with sales outpacing the market in most regions.Double-digit growth at Census was driven by a Censo . Censis is also seeing strong demand for its AIT productivity platform and continues to drive productivity improvements through the application of FBS tools, which have accelerated the time from bookings to revenue. FHS saw solid demand for equipment orders and dosimetry services despite continued supply chain strengths that stalled equipment shipment. Lastly, Provation continues to perform very well with another quarter of double-digit growth driven by its Apex SaaS offering. Apex has seen continued high customer demand with substantial Q1 orders and a greater than 3x average revenue uplift from license migrations. Following a strong start to the year, we continue to expect the probations growth will accelerate through 2023 supported by customers looking to further standardize our formation across their health systems.In addition to our remarks on the first quarter performance, we thought it would be helpful to provide more detail on our expectations for the AHS segment for the remainder of this year. The headline is that we expect sequential improvement in both revenue and adjusted operating profit margin as we move through the year. Specifically on revenue, we expect favorable price in addition to the recovery of electric procedures in China resolution of supply chain challenges at Fluke Health Solutions and normal healthcare seasonality to drive higher volumes over the course of the year. As a result, we expect core growth will go from low single digit in Q2 to mid-single digit in the second half of the year. On margins, in addition to the uplift from higher volumes and favorable price, we see compounding tailwinds from the benefits of the productivity initiatives taking second half margins to approximately 25%.Go-to-market changes in ASP consumables in North America will improve performance and enable closer connection to our customers to better serve their needs, transitioning from a primarily distribution model to direct to the customer. All these actions will have carryover benefits in the years to come, positioning us for accelerated growth and profitability as the general healthcare environment continues to improve. With that, I'll pass it over to Chuck, who will provide more color on our first quarter financials and our 2023 outlook.Charles McLaughlin: Thanks, Jim, and hello, everyone. I will begin on Slide 11 with a quick recap of our first quarter revenue performance for Fortive. We generated year-over-year core revenue growth of 9%. FX was 230 basis points of headwind to growth. Turning to the geographies. We saw another quarter of strong revenue growth in each of our major regions. North America revenue was up mid-single digits, with growth in all 3 segments. Western Europe revenue grew high single digit with mid-single-digit growth at IOS and AHS and double-digit growth at PT. Asia revenue increased in the 20% range with low 30% growth in China driven by strength in both IOS and PT as we lapped easier prior year comps. Growth in China was partially offset by a high single-digit decline in AHS related to lower electric procedures due to COVID as we expected.Lastly, our high-growth markets together posted strong core growth of almost 20%. Turning to Slide 12. We show operating performance highlights for the first quarter. Adjusted gross margins increased 80 basis points to 58.4%. As Jim mentioned, FBS driven productivity and price realization more than offset inflation, leading to record gross margins in the first quarter, which was complemented by higher volumes. Adjusted operating margins expanded to 100 basis points to 24%, while adjusted earnings per share increased 7% to $0.75, reflecting strong volume conversion, partially offset by higher interest and tax expense. Free cash flow was $150 million. While first quarter is typically our largest free cash flow quarter, receivables were negatively impacted by slower China collections in the quarter, which has since recovered in AHS.Turning now to the guide on Slide 13. We are raising and narrowing our previous 2023 guidance to reflect outperformance in the first quarter. For the second quarter, we anticipate core revenue growth of 2.5% to 4.5% with an FX headwind of approximately 0.5%. Adjusted operating profit margin is expected to increase 3% to 7% with margins in the range of 24.5% to 25%. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance of $0.78 to $0.82, flat, up 5%, includes higher year-over-year interest and tax expense and free cash flow of approximately $285 million reflects approximately 100% of cash conversion in the quarter. For the full year, we now expect core revenue in the range of 4% to 5.5%, which continues to reflect year-over-year foreign exchange headwind of just under 1 point of revenue.Adjusted operating profit is expected to increase 6% to 10%, with margins in the range of 25% to 25.5%. We are increasing our adjusted diluted net EPS guidance to $3.29, $3.40, which represents an increase of 4% to 8% and includes higher year-over-year interest and tax expense, as previously expected. Free cash flow is expected to be approximately $1.25 billion, representing conversion in the range of 100% to 105% of adjusted net income and 21% free cash flow margin. Turning to Slide 14. We've consistently said that the Fortive today is delivering a higher and more profitable growth. There is nowhere that this shows up more than in our free cash flow. Between 2019 and today, we have more than doubled our annual free cash flow, and we expect to continue to further enhance our compounding model with over $5 billion of capacity for M&A, enabling us to continue to invest appropriately in our businesses to further position Fortive for long-term value creation.With that, I'll pass it back to Jim to review our upcoming Investor Day and provide some closing comments.James Lico: Thanks, Chuck. I'll now start to wrap up on Slide 15. Our team is thrilled to be back in New York for our first in-person Investor Day since 2019 to be held on May 25. We are looking forward to highlighting our progress, executing our strategy and the results that has yielded over the last 7 years, building on our strong foundation and enduring principles that underpin our execution capabilities. We will showcase how our businesses have leveraged FBS tools to innovate, take advantage of the secular tailwinds, accelerating progress across our 5 critical customer workflows. This has translated into relevant product innovations helping to solve our customers' toughest safety, quality and productivity challenges and contributing to sustained strong growth for Fortive.In the spirit of setting high expectations, we will set long-term targets. Looking out 3 and 5 years, culminating with the evolution of our strong free cash flow, supporting us ample opportunities to further accelerate our strategy. We are actively fueling our future success by building on the transformation progress and learning that has taken place since our inception, unlocking future value for Fortive. Wrapping up on Slide 16. The combination of portfolio work we have done and the productivity initiatives we are implementing in the first half of 2023, prepare us for the continuing evolving macro environment and set us up for differentiated performance again in 2024. As you saw in today's press release, we're also continuing to build on our exceptional leadership culture for the Fortive of the future by expanding Tammy Newcombe's responsibilities to include the Advanced Healthcare Solutions segment in addition to our current role as segment leader of Precision Technologies succeeding Pat Murphy, who will retire at the end of the year.As you heard today, FBS is more robust than ever with powerful new capabilities to bring breakthrough innovations to market for our customers faster and drive enhanced business results. The evidence of this is reflected in our strong financial performance, including our free cash flow, the currency we use to measure our success. These factors culminate in the powerful formula for value creation, enabling Fortive to make a real difference in the world and deliver exceptional value to shareholders. With that, I'll turn it back to Elena.Elena Rosman: Thanks, Jim. That concludes our formal comments.

2023-05-06,"Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Amphenol Corporation (NYSE:APH). The company's stock received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NYSE over the last few months, increasing to US$82.09 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$73.91. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Amphenol's current trading price of US$75.71 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Amphenol’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for Amphenol What Is Amphenol Worth?The stock is currently trading at US$75.71 on the share market, which means it is overvalued by 33% compared to my intrinsic value of $56.75. Not the best news for investors looking to buy! But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Amphenol’s share price is quite volatile, this could mean it can sink lower (or rise even further) in the future, giving us another chance to invest. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What kind of growth will Amphenol generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by a double-digit 14% over the next couple of years, the outlook is positive for Amphenol. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in APH’s positive outlook, with shares trading above its fair value. However, this brings up another question – is now the right time to sell? If you believe APH should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on APH for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there’s no upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for APH, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing.

2023-05-07,"The board of Seagate Technology Holdings plc (NASDAQ:STX) has announced that it will pay a dividend of $0.70 per share on the 5th of July. Based on this payment, the dividend yield on the company's stock will be 5.0%, which is an attractive boost to shareholder returns. View our latest analysis for Seagate Technology Holdings Seagate Technology Holdings' Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsImpressive dividend yields are good, but this doesn't matter much if the payments can't be sustained. The company is paying out a large amount of its cash flows, even though it isn't generating any profit. This is quite a strong warning sign that the dividend may not be sustainable.The next 12 months could see EPS growing very rapidly. Assuming the dividend continues along the path it has been on, the payout ratio could get to 94% which is certainly still sustainable.historic-dividendSeagate Technology Holdings Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $1.28 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $2.80. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 8.1% a year over that time. The growth of the dividend has been pretty reliable, so we think this can offer investors some nice additional income in their portfolio.The Dividend's Growth Prospects Are LimitedInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. However, things aren't all that rosy. Although it's important to note that Seagate Technology Holdings' earnings per share has basically not grown from where it was five years ago, which could erode the purchasing power of the dividend over time.The Dividend Could Prove To Be UnreliableOverall, it's nice to see a consistent dividend payment, but we think that longer term, the current level of payment might be unsustainable. Although they have been consistent in the past, we think the payments are a little high to be sustained. We would probably look elsewhere for an income investment.Story continuesIt's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. For instance, we've picked out 3 warning signs for Seagate Technology Holdings that investors should take into consideration. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

2023-05-10,"The cruise industry faced severe setbacks in 2020 with travel restrictions and health concerns surrounding the Covid-19 virus leading to the suspension of operations and the cancellation of numerous bookings. However, with the gradual reopening of economies and the restoration of consumer confidence, the industry is making a comeback and regaining some lost ground. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NYSE:NCLH), one of the key players, stands out in this industry as it capitalizes on the post-pandemic recovery due to several key factors.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with NCLH. Click here to check it out. NCLH 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of NCLHPeter Lynch Chart of NCLHNorwegian Cruise enjoys strong brand recognition and a devoted customer base; two factors that are helping it gain momentum as the demand for cruise travel increases. Furthermore, the company's innovative product offerings and adaptable financial strategy further bolster its position. With a fleet of 30 ships that traverse over 500 destinations globally, the company is one of the largest cruise line operators in the world.What sets Norwegian Cruise apart from the competition is its unique ""freestyle cruising"" concept, enabling guests to tailor their vacations by providing an extensive range of choices in dining, entertainment and activities. This emphasis on customization and flexibility appeals to both new and repeat customers seeking personalized experiences. The company's recovery strategy is proving to be successful, as evidenced by its first-quarter financial results that surpassed expectations across all key metrics.Improving numbersOn May 1, the company's first-quarter 2023 results showcased its resilience and adaptability. Norwegian Cruise Line surpassed analysts' expectations with a lower-than-expected net loss and higher-than-expected revenue. Revenue of $1.82 billion marked a 249% year-over-year increase, driven by a full restart of operations after the challenging period of suspended voyages from 2020 through May of 2022. The company reported a net loss of $159.30 million, an improvement of more than 84% from the previous year.Story continuesOne of the key factors contributing to Norwegians recent success is its phased occupancy ramp-up strategy, which achieved a 15-point sequential improvement to approximately 101.5% in the first quarter. This surpassed the guidance of approximately 100%, reflecting the company's commitment to delivering exceptional guest experiences. Furthermore, the initiative is expected to be completed in the second quarter at approximately 105%, demonstrating the company's strategic shift toward longer, more immersive itineraries.The strong consumer demand is also evident in the companys cumulative booked position for the remainder of 2023, which is ahead of 2019 levels. Despite only an 18% increase in capacity, the booked position continues to show promising growth, accompanied by higher pricing. As of March 31, the company achieved a record advance ticket sales balance of $3.4 billion, representing a significant increase of approximately 26% compared to the previous quarter and around 60% compared to the first quarter of 2019.Norwegian Cruise also continues to focus on enhancing onboard revenue generation and increasing pre-sold revenue from guests prior to sailing. This approach has proven effective in driving higher overall spending throughout the cruise journey, bolstering the company's financial performance. As a result, total revenue per passenger cruise day exhibited a notable increase of approximately 18.3% in constant currency during the quarter compared to 2019.The companys dedication to enhancing liquidity and financial flexibility remains unwavering. As of March 31, the company's total debt stood at $13.1 billion, while its liquidity reached approximately $1.9 billion. This includes $701 million in cash and cash equivalents, nearly $600 million available under its revolving loan facility and a $650 million undrawn commitment. The company is also set to benefit from an additional unsecured and undrawn commitment of $300 million, which will enhance future liquidity. Further, the companys proactive measures to optimize its balance sheet and reduce leverage include increasing export credit agency-backed commitments by approximately 1.7 billion euros ($1.86 billion) in April. These additional funds will be utilized to finance improvements, changes and modifications to certain newbuilds, reinforcing the companys commitment to enhancing its offerings and ensuring an exceptional guest experience.Additionally, the company's ongoing margin enhancement initiative has started to yield positive results, as evidenced by the significant sequential improvement in operating costs during the first quarter. Gross cruise costs per capacity day decreased to approximately $301 in constant currency, compared to $323 in the second half of 2022. Moreover, adjusted net cruise costs, excluding fuel per capacity day in constant currency, improved to approximately $161 compared to $187 in the second half of 2022, which was better than the guidance of $165. These cost savings from the margin enhancement initiative were realized earlier than anticipated.Norwegian Cruise is also awaiting its return to sailing in Asia with its newly revitalized Norwegian Jewel set to make a grand entrance to Tokyo on Oct. 19 after more than three years. The company believes Asia is a key market today and that adventure-loving guests will book Asia-bound cruises later this year.During Norwegian Jewel's extensive six-month Asia season, it will offer 16 immersive itineraries visiting 11 countries and sailing from nine different departure ports. These ports include Tokyo, Yokohama, Taipei, Bangkok, Bali and Kuala Lumpur. The itineraries range from 10 to 14 days, allowing travelers to explore various destinations at their own pace.The companys focus on destination immersion ensures guests will have the opportunity to experience the wonders of trending destinations like Japan, the Philippines and Indonesia. The itineraries also provide flexibility, allowing passengers to combine their cruise with land tours. Moreover, there will be fewer sea days, longer stays in ports and more overnight stays, giving guests ample time to explore and enjoy the vibrant cities and cultures of Asia.With the industry's recovery underway, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings is confident in its ability to navigate the post-pandemic landscape successfully. By focusing on enhancing its offerings, fortifying its financial position and prioritizing guest satisfaction, the company aims to establish a solid foundation for sustained and profitable growth in the long run.TakeawayWith impressive passenger revenues, rising occupancy rates and a reduction in operating costs, Norwegian Cruise Line is well-positioned to capitalize on the anticipated rebound in demand for cruise vacations. At a forward price-earnings ratio of 17, the stock is not too expensively valued, presenting a good opportunity for value investors to consider before the company's improving financials push the share price higher.This article first appeared on GuruFocus."

2023-05-13,"Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE:WHR) stock is about to trade ex-dividend in 4 days. The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. Thus, you can purchase Whirlpool's shares before the 18th of May in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 15th of June.The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.75 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$7.00 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Whirlpool stock has a trailing yield of around 5.4% on the current share price of $130.59. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing. Check out our latest analysis for Whirlpool Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Whirlpool paid a dividend last year despite being unprofitable. This might be a one-off event, but it's not a sustainable state of affairs in the long run. Considering the lack of profitability, we also need to check if the company generated enough cash flow to cover the dividend payment. If Whirlpool didn't generate enough cash to pay the dividend, then it must have either paid from cash in the bank or by borrowing money, neither of which is sustainable in the long term. It paid out more than half (58%) of its free cash flow in the past year, which is within an average range for most companies.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies that aren't growing their earnings can still be valuable, but it is even more important to assess the sustainability of the dividend if it looks like the company will struggle to grow. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. Whirlpool reported a loss last year, and the general trend suggests its earnings have also been declining in recent years, making us wonder if the dividend is at risk.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. In the past 10 years, Whirlpool has increased its dividend at approximately 13% a year on average.Get our latest analysis on Whirlpool's balance sheet health here.Final TakeawayFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Whirlpool? First, it's not great to see the company paying a dividend despite being loss-making over the last year. On the plus side, the dividend was covered by free cash flow."" It's not an attractive combination from a dividend perspective, and we're inclined to pass on this one for the time being.With that being said, if you're still considering Whirlpool as an investment, you'll find it beneficial to know what risks this stock is facing. Our analysis shows 3 warning signs for Whirlpool that we strongly recommend you have a look at before investing in the company.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

2023-05-14,"Dominion Energy, Inc.'s (NYSE:D) investors are due to receive a payment of $0.6675 per share on 20th of June. This makes the dividend yield 4.8%, which will augment investor returns quite nicely. Check out our latest analysis for Dominion Energy Dominion Energy's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsWe like to see robust dividend yields, but that doesn't matter if the payment isn't sustainable. Based on the last payment, earnings were actually smaller than the dividend, and the company was actually spending more cash than it was making. Paying out such a large dividend compared to earnings while also not generating free cash flows is a major warning sign for the sustainability of the dividend as these levels are certainly a bit high.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 171.7% over the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along the course it has been charting recently, our estimates show the payout ratio being 67% which brings it into quite a comfortable range.historic-dividendDividend VolatilityAlthough the company has a long dividend history, it has been cut at least once in the last 10 years. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $2.11, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $2.67. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 2.4% per annum over that time. We're glad to see the dividend has risen, but with a limited rate of growth and fluctuations in the payments the total shareholder return may be limited.The Dividend Has Limited Growth PotentialWith a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to see if earnings per share is growing. Over the past five years, it looks as though Dominion Energy's EPS has declined at around 20% a year. This steep decline can indicate that the business is going through a tough time, which could constrain its ability to pay a larger dividend each year in the future. It's not all bad news though, as the earnings are predicted to rise over the next 12 months - we would just be a bit cautious until this becomes a long term trend.Story continuesWe're Not Big Fans Of Dominion Energy's DividendOverall, while some might be pleased that the dividend wasn't cut, we think this may help Dominion Energy make more consistent payments in the future. The company seems to be stretching itself a bit to make such big payments, but it doesn't appear they can be consistent over time. Considering all of these factors, we wouldn't rely on this dividend if we wanted to live on the income.Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. For example, we've identified 5 warning signs for Dominion Energy (2 make us uncomfortable!) that you should be aware of before investing. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

2023-05-19,"(0:30) - Breaking Down Berkshire Hathaway’s Portfolio(3:00) - Warren Buffett's Current Buy and Sells(18:00) - Episode Roundup: RH, WSM, TJX, COF, MA, V, BAC Podcast@Zacks.com Welcome to Episode #328 of the Value Investor Podcast.Every week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio, shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks.The quarterly 13-F filings are out. Remember, the 13-Fs are released 45 days after the end of the quarter. They provide the stock purchases, and sales, of the big portfolio managers.Many managers toil away in relative obscurity, known only by their own investors. But that is not the case with the most famous value manager, Berkshire Hathaway’s Warren Buffett.This quarter’s 13-F was released on May 15, after the market closed. Tracey went on Whale Wisdom, one of the popular 13-F websites, to see Berkshire’s filing, and it was so busy she couldn’t get on the page. It gave her an error message about too many users.But is it all this hype over nothing?One New BuyIt turns out, Berkshire didn’t do much with its money in Q1 in terms of buying equities. It still has $130 billion sitting there, ready to be deployed.1.       Capital One Financial (COF)Buffett added a new $1 billion position in Capital One Financial in Q1. It’s a financial company that is well known for its credit card business, but also offers auto loans, and personal and commercial banking. This is a small position for the overall portfolio.Shares of Capital One Financial are up 6.7% year-to-date but are down 13.3% over the last year. It’s cheap, with a forward P/E of 7.8.Capital One Financial pays a dividend, currently yielding 2.5%.Did you know that Berkshire already owns two other major credit card companies?2.       Visa Corporation (V)How many know that Berkshire owns Visa? It first bought shares in the third quarter of 2011. That was good timing.Story continuesShares of Visa are up 963% since Aug 31, 2011. But the Visa position is still very small in the Berkshire portfolio. It’s just 0.58%.Why hasn’t Berkshire bought more over the years? Maybe valuation played a factor. Visa trades at 27x earnings.3.       Mastercard Inc. (MA)Did you know that Berkshire owns Mastercard as well? Berkshire bought it first, in the first quarter of 2011. It must have liked what it saw, and then bought Visa two quarters later.Mastercard is just 0.45% of the portfolio. That’s a very small position which won’t move the needle much, if at all.It’s too bad it’s so small because shares of Mastercard are up 1,479% since Feb 28, 2011. It’s been a great performer.Mastercard is even more expensive, on a P/E basis, than Visa. It’s trading at 31x. Valuation could also be the reason Buffett doesn’t add to the Mastercard position.A Surprising Sale in Q1There were several trims of various positions in Q1, including selling some of the Amazon position, but there was also one surprise sale: RH. It didn’t just trim it. It sold ALL of it. Berkshire Hathaway already owns several furniture companies. Did they just not want to own another?It was a small position in the portfolio, just 0.2%, so the shareholders won’t even notice. But it was still a surprise.4.       RH (RH)RH is a luxury lifestyle brand that sells furniture, offers interior design services and has hospitality offerings in hotels and restaurants. Berkshire first bought shares in the third quarter of 2019. It stayed committed throughout the pandemic, even on the initial stock panic.But shares of RH are down 56% the last 2 years. RH’s earnings are expected to fall 43% this year.RH also isn’t cheap. It trading with a forward P/E of 21.It will report earnings again on May 25, 2023.5.       Williams-Sonoma, Inc. (WSM)No, Berkshire doesn’t own Williams-Sonoma, but maybe it should. It owns the top retail furniture brand in West Elm. It’s stock has also had a rough 2 years, falling 28%. But Williams-Sonoma is now cheap, with a forward P/E of 8.3. It’s earnings are also expected to fall, but only 18.8% from last year.Williams-Sonoma also pays a dividend, currently yielding 3.1%.What Else do Value Investors Need to Know About What Berkshire Is Buying and Selling?

2023-05-21,"What underlying fundamental trends can indicate that a company might be in decline? Typically, we'll see the trend of both return on capital employed (ROCE) declining and this usually coincides with a decreasing amount of capital employed. This indicates the company is producing less profit from its investments and its total assets are decreasing. On that note, looking into Clorox (NYSE:CLX), we weren't too upbeat about how things were going.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for Clorox, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.19 = US$738m ÷ (US$5.8b - US$2.0b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).Therefore, Clorox has an ROCE of 19%. In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Household Products industry average of 13% it's much better. See our latest analysis for Clorox roceIn the above chart we have measured Clorox's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What Does the ROCE Trend For Clorox Tell Us?We are a bit worried about the trend of returns on capital at Clorox. Unfortunately the returns on capital have diminished from the 32% that they were earning five years ago. On top of that, it's worth noting that the amount of capital employed within the business has remained relatively steady. Since returns are falling and the business has the same amount of assets employed, this can suggest it's a mature business that hasn't had much growth in the last five years. If these trends continue, we wouldn't expect Clorox to turn into a multi-bagger.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayAll in all, the lower returns from the same amount of capital employed aren't exactly signs of a compounding machine. Yet despite these concerning fundamentals, the stock has performed strongly with a 55% return over the last five years, so investors appear very optimistic. In any case, the current underlying trends don't bode well for long term performance so unless they reverse, we'd start looking elsewhere.On a separate note, we've found   4 warning signs for Clorox   you'll probably want to know about.While Clorox isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

2023-05-22,"David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. As with many other companies The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) makes use of debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.Why Does Debt Bring Risk?Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together. View our latest analysis for Coca-Cola What Is Coca-Cola's Net Debt?You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that as of March 2023 Coca-Cola had US$43.9b of debt, an increase on US$42.1b, over one year. On the flip side, it has US$14.3b in cash leading to net debt of about US$29.6b.debt-equity-history-analysisA Look At Coca-Cola's LiabilitiesThe latest balance sheet data shows that Coca-Cola had liabilities of US$23.4b due within a year, and liabilities of US$47.2b falling due after that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$14.3b and US$4.60b worth of receivables due within a year. So its liabilities total US$51.6b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.Given Coca-Cola has a humongous market capitalization of US$271.7b, it's hard to believe these liabilities pose much threat. Having said that, it's clear that we should continue to monitor its balance sheet, lest it change for the worse.Story continuesWe measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.We'd say that Coca-Cola's moderate net debt to EBITDA ratio ( being 2.2), indicates prudence when it comes to debt. And its commanding EBIT of 33.2 times its interest expense, implies the debt load is as light as a peacock feather. Notably Coca-Cola's EBIT was pretty flat over the last year. Ideally it can diminish its debt load by kick-starting earnings growth. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Coca-Cola's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Finally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow. Over the last three years, Coca-Cola recorded free cash flow worth a fulsome 84% of its EBIT, which is stronger than we'd usually expect. That puts it in a very strong position to pay down debt.Our ViewCoca-Cola's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And the good news does not stop there, as its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow also supports that impression! Taking all this data into account, it seems to us that Coca-Cola takes a pretty sensible approach to debt. That means they are taking on a bit more risk, in the hope of boosting shareholder returns. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet.   We've identified 2 warning signs  with Coca-Cola , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.When all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt.

SPGI, has been reporting better-than-expected earnings performance in three of the four trailing quarters owing to the continued demand for the company’s innovative acquisitions and business information services. Shareholder-friendly policies also bode well. On the other hand, SPGI is likely to be troubled by low liquidity.Shares of SPGI have outperformed its industry in the past year. The company’s share increased 3.2% against the 0.2% decrease of its industry.S&P Global Inc. PriceS&P Global Inc. PriceS&P Global Inc. price | S&P Global Inc. QuoteS&P Global reported impressive first-quarter 2023 results, wherein both earnings and revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Adjusted earnings per share (excluding 68 cents from non-recurring items) of $3.15 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7.9% and rose 9% year over year. Revenues of $3.16 billion surpassed the consensus estimate by 3.6% and improved 32.3% year over year, backed by the inclusion of IHS Markit businesses.Current Situation of SPGIThe increase in demand for business information services has been one of the success factors for S&P Global.

2023-05-25,"In physics, gravitation dictates that what goes up must come down. The stock market, however, is a bit less predictable. Stocks can follow the crowd, buck the market’s trend, or just mosey along.This year, energy stocks are bringing up the bottom of the pack, underperforming the broader markets. However, it’s worth noting that what goes down can still come back up. In this regard, investment giant Goldman Sachs has been identifying energy stocks that are primed for a turnaround.In a note authored by 5-star analyst Neil Mehta, the Goldman view is laid out clearly, presenting several reasons why energy stocks are weak this year, including: “1) higher than expected Russia oil supply, 2) concerns about industrial demand… [and] 3) lower natural gas prices…”Mehta goes on to explain in more depth why a rebound is in the offing, saying, “While we recognize the environment is more challenging for Energy equities than the 2021/2022 recovery, we do believe there are attractive opportunities given valuation, capital returns and thematic tailwinds for many of the companies in our coverage…. For these stocks, we believe the risk-reward will improve as positive catalysts begin to materialize.”Now, let’s take a closer look at some of the energy companies that Mehta and his colleague Umang Choudhary believe will realize gains on improved risk/reward. Here are details on two of them, along with the analysts’ comments.Halliburton Company (HAL)The first Goldman energy pick we’ll look at is Halliburton, one of the world’s largest oilfield services companies. Oilfield services play a vital role in the energy production chain, encompassing various technical and engineering functions. These companies provide the expertise needed to operate oil and gas wells, conduct horizontal drilling and fracking operations, maintain fluid pumps and pipelines, and safely decommission and plug non-productive wells — and that’s just a glimpse of their extensive responsibilities. Without companies like Halliburton, the oil and gas giants would face significant challenges in extracting the product from the ground.Story continuesHalliburton has certainly capitalized on these opportunities, experiencing significant business growth. With a market cap exceeding $27 billion and revenue surpassing $20 billion last year, the company has consistently achieved year-over-year gains in quarterly revenue for several years. Impressively, the last four quarters have all demonstrated top-line figures of $5 billion or higher.In the most recent quarter, 1Q23, Halliburton recorded total revenues of $5.7 billion, surpassing estimates by $210 million and achieving a 33% growth compared to the year-ago period. The company’s earnings stood at $0.72 per share, exceeding expectations by 5 cents and more than doubling the figure from 1Q22. Notably, Halliburton’s strong revenue performance was supported by both of its major divisions: Completion and Production witnessed a 45% year-over-year increase, reaching $3.4 billion, while Drilling and Evaluation saw a 17% year-over-year gain, totaling $2.3 billion.In addition to its sound financial performance, Halliburton kept up its commitment to shareholder capital return. The company bought back $100 million worth of shares in Q1, and its most recent dividend, declared earlier this month for a June 28 payout, was set at 16 cents per share. The company has been raising its dividend post-COVID, after slashing it during the height of the pandemic crisis.Even though HAL shares can rest on a solid foundation, they are down 21% so far this year. Goldman’s Neil Mehta, however, sees that as an opportunity for investors to buy in on a quality stock at a discount.“At current valuation levels we view several factors as underappreciated. First, ~50%+ of revenues in 2024 will likely come from international operations. Second, we do not expect natural gas will be at $2.00-$2.50/MMBtu Henry Hub into perpetuity, with our mid-cycle closer to $3.50/MMBtu. Third, the valuation is compelling, with HAL now trading at a ~2.5x discount to large cap services on 2023 and 2024 estimates vs the historical range of 1.5x-2.0x,” Mehta opined.Quantifying his stance, Mehta gives HAL a Buy rating with a $45 price target, indicating his confidence in a 46% upside potential on the one-year horizon. (To watch Mehta’s track record, click here)Overall, this stock gets a unanimous Strong Buy from the analyst consensus, based on 9 positive reviews posted in recent weeks. The shares are selling for $30.82 and the $46.67 average price target suggests a 51% increase from that level. (See HAL stock forecast)Antero Resources (AR)Next up is Antero Resources, a natural gas producer operating in the Marcellus and Utica shale formations along the upper Ohio River. These formations are located in the rich Appalachian gas fields, specifically in the states of West Virginia and Ohio. Antero holds extensive holdings in both formations, with a total of 512,000 net acres. Moreover, the company boasts over 1,200 producing horizontal wells.Antero’s wells are tapping into the world’s second-largest proven natural gas field, with more than 410 trillion cubic feet of gas within reach. The company is a major supplier of gas for the liquified natural gas market, both in the US and abroad. In addition, Antero works with a midstream affiliate that provides pipelines, compression, and processing assets, making it a fully integrated natural gas producer and supplier.Having such a strong base allowed Antero to post solid production growth numbers in the recent first quarter. In the first three months of this year, Antero averaged a net production of 3.3 billion cubic feet equivalent per day, representing a year-over-year gain of 3%. This growth was fueled by a 17% increase in natural gas liquids production, which rose to reach 187 thousand barrels per day (MBbl/d). However, natural gas production in Q1, at 2.2 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d), declined by 3% compared to the previous year.On the financial end, Antero brought in $1.4 billion at the top line in 1Q23, for a 79% increase from the prior-year period. At the bottom line, the company’s 69 cent EPS was a powerful turnaround from the 50-cent EPS loss reported in 1Q22. Both the revenue and EPS beat expectations in Q1, the top line by $201.8 million and the bottom line by 29 cents per share. On product pricing, Antero holds a strong position. During Q1, the company realized a 71-cent premium per Mcfe, when compared to NYMEX gas pricing.Even though Antero has done well on production and earnings this year, the company’s free cash flow in Q1 fell 44% year-over-year, although it remained substantial, at $174 million.Antero’s stock is also down sharply, with shares plummeting by 25% year-to-date. This stands in sharp contrast to the 7% gain recorded on the S&P 500.The fall in share price has not prevented Goldman Sachs analyst Umang Choudhary from coming down firmly on the bullish side for this stock. He sees Antero well positioned to move forward, and lays out three reasons why: “(1) our positive view on NGLs prices longer-term; (2) higher cash returns to shareholders given its strong balance sheet; and (3) attractive Appalachia assets and its ability to achieve premium pricing for 75% of its gas sold in the Gulf Coast.”“Despite challenges to near-term FCF generation due to a combination of weaker gas/NGL prices, we believe the company is well positioned to benefit in 2024/25 with higher NGLs/gas prices which should drive a material re-rate in FCF yields — we expect a 13% FCF yield on average in 2024-26 vs. peers at 12%. AR plans to deploy bulk of the FCF towards a capital returns program. We believe confidence in higher gas/NGLs prices along with capital returns execution can drive upside to shares,” the analyst explained.Choudhary goes on to give this stock a Buy rating, and a price target of $29 per share, suggesting ~25% upside for the year ahead.The rest of Wall Street’s analyst corps are split down the middle on this one. With an additional 6 Buys and Holds, each, the stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating. However, the outlook is more conclusive where the share price is concerned; going by the $30.91 average target, the stock is expected to add 32% of value over the coming year.

2023-05-27,"Key InsightsUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Hershey fair value estimate is US$191Hershey's US$258 share price signals that it might be 35% overvalued Analyst price target for HSY is US$270, which is 41% above our fair value estimateToday we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of The Hershey Company (NYSE:HSY) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. View our latest analysis for Hershey The ModelWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.58bUS$1.89bUS$2.14bUS$2.14bUS$2.12bUS$2.12bUS$2.14bUS$2.16bUS$2.19bUS$2.23bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x5Analyst x5Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 0.13%Est @ 0.73%Est @ 1.14%Est @ 1.43%Est @ 1.64% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.9% US$1.5kUS$1.7kUS$1.8kUS$1.6kUS$1.5kUS$1.4kUS$1.3kUS$1.3kUS$1.2kUS$1.1k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$14bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.2b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (6.9%– 2.1%) = US$48bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$48b÷ ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$25bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$39b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$258, the company appears reasonably expensive at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Hershey as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for HersheyStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Food industry.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Food market.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Can we work out why the company is trading at a premium to intrinsic value?

2023-05-28,"In this article, we will take a look at ChatGPT stock portfolio. To see more such companies, go directly to ChatGPT Stock Portfolio: Top 5 Picks.If there’s one thing that can be learned from literally hundreds of ChatGPT-related posts out there claiming that the AI chatbot has successfully beaten the market, it’s that ChatGPT’s responses show huge variance based on the input it receives and one should learn to enjoy and benefit from the diversity of possibilities offered by AI. In January this year, people at Bloomberg asked ChatGPT to make an ETF to beat the US stock market. ChatGPT gave nothing in return but the age-old cliché statement to the effect of “past performance doesn’t guarantee future returns” and that it’s not possible to beat the market for it due to massive volatility.But many experts were able to force ChatGPT to blurt out a list of stocks by asking it to act as an expert stock adviser. To check out some stocks recommended by ChatGPT, see our article published back in March where we asked ChatGPT to pick stocks that have the potential to make investors rich.Investors have been toying with the idea of using AI to beat the market for quite some time now. Back in 2021, when Sam Altman’s OpenAI was perhaps getting ready to unleash the market-moving, earth-shattering thing that is ChatGPT, Bloomberg had reported that researchers at the University of Oxford claimed they have come up with a machine learning model with a capability to predict stock price movements. They claimed that the model posted a whopping 80% success rate for the equivalent of about 30 seconds of live trading.The Bloomberg report at the time said that the researchers, who were backed by the UK-based Man Group, used natural-language processing algorithms to process trading data. The report said that the algorithm managed to predict the future trajectory of a price over a period of 100 ticks.The Buzzword GameWe’ll take a detailed look at whether or not AI is good at stock picking but one thing is for sure: AI has a huge impact on the stock markets, so much so that many investors are comparing the AI-driven stock market gains to the ones seen in the crypto markets and during the dot-com era. Just look at what’s happening at companies’ earnings calls. Companies are repeatedly using buzzwords like “generative AI”, “large language models”, “artificial intelligence”, etc. during their earnings call and shareholder meetings. Bloomberg in a report quoted interesting data points which show that the use of the word “artificial intelligence” jumped a whopping 85% during earnings calls. There’s a reason why everyone is talking about AI. Whenever a company announces plans to somehow deploy AI in its operations, its stock price jumps. Even non-tech companies like Wendy’s enjoyed stock price gains when they announced plans to cut costs using AI.Story continuesWhat's Happening with NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)?But what’s happening with NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is strange and highly unprecedented. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares skyrocketed by 25% on May 25 after the company posted solid quarterly results and gave a revenue guidance of $11 billion for the second quarter, shocking Wall Street analysts who have a $7.2 billion estimate for the metric. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s guided revenue is up 64% from the year-ago period, and comes on the huge demand fueled by the widespread use of applications like ChatGPT.Dan Ives of Wedbus commented on this development:""In 22 years of covering tech stocks and large cap we have never seen a guidance range of this magnitude on a large cap tech name…And thus speaks to our thesis that the monetization of AI for stalwarts like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Oracle Corporation (NASDAQ:ORCL), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE:CRM) is well underway.""NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s management during the company’s Q4 earnings call was already pointing to the huge potential coming from the generative AI space. Here’s what the company’s CEO Jensen Huang had said:""The cumulation of technology breakthroughs has brought AI to an inflection point. Generative AI’s versatility and capability has triggered a sense of urgency at enterprises around the world to develop and deploy AI strategies. Yet, the AI supercomputer infrastructure, model algorithms, data processing and training techniques remain an insurmountable obstacle for most.

ODFL shares have declined 6.2% in the past three months compared with the fall of 2.3% of the industry it belongs to. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Reasons for the DownsideEven though capital expenditures are aimed at driving long-term growth, high capex may hurt the company in the near term. Capex was $225.1 million in 2020, $550.1 million in 2021 and $775.1 million in 2022.Capital expenditures totaled $234.7 million in first-quarter 2023.

Of the total, $260 million is anticipated to be invested in real estate and service center expansion projects, $365 million in tractors and trailers, and $75 million in information technology and other assets.The elevated capex may hurt the company's free cash flow generating ability.The truck industry, of which Old Dominion is an integral part, has been persistently battling driver shortage for several years. As old drivers are retiring, trucking companies are finding it difficult to hire new drivers since the job mostly does not appeal to the younger generation.According to an estimate given by Costello, the United States will face a crisis of 100,000 drivers in five years and a further crunch of 160,000 drivers by 2028. The projection does not bode well for Old Dominion.Unfavorable Estimates RevisionDue to the above headwinds, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings have plunged 15.1% to $2.69 per share in the past 60 days.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderODFL currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks for investors interested in the Zacks Transportation sector are Copa Holdings, S.A.

2023-06-01,"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – June 1, 2023 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Canadian National Railway Co. CNI, Union Pacific Corp. UNP, Norfolk Southern Corp. NSC and CSX Corp. CSX.Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:Are Railroad Companies Becoming More Employee Friendly?The Zacks Transportation - Rail industry’s participants are being weighed down by challenges like inflation-induced high interest rates, elevated fuel prices and supply-chain woes. Most industry players are looking to drive their bottom line amid the headwinds through cost reduction.Partly due to these headwinds, the industry has declined 4% so far this year, underperforming the S&P 500 Index’s 10.7% appreciation and 2.4% rise of the broader Zacks Transportation sector.Despite the challenges surrounding the industry, it has been an encouraging move on railroad companies’ part to take care of employees’ needs by entering into collective deals with the unions. Companies like Canadian National Railway Co., Union Pacific Corp., Norfolk Southern Corp. and CSX Corp. have tried to address their employees’ requirements through multiple initiatives such as by increasing their paid sick leaves, offering them better working schedules to ensure a balanced personal and professional life and improving working conditions.Each of the abovementioned stocks carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Canadian National recently announced that its collective agreement with Teamsters Canada Rail Conference (TCRC) has been ratified. The union represents almost 6,000 Canadian National locomotive engineers, conductors, yard conductors and yard coordinators working in Canada.Story continuesTracy Robinson, president and chief executive officer of CNI, stated, “We are pleased that TCRC members have ratified the collective agreement reached earlier this year. We thank the TCRC leadership for their engagement throughout this process.  We remain committed to working with this important group to ensure continued service for our customers and improved working conditions for our team members.""Union Pacific has entered into a tentative agreement with the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET). The deal is aimed at improving the quality of life for Union Pacific’s locomotive engineers and their families by offering them better working schedules.UNP employs nearly 5,600 locomotive engineers represented by BLET. The tentative deal offers locomotive engineers 11 days on and four days off schedule. This deal should help UNP progress productively with its employees with the new work/rest schedules.Norfolk Southern has entered into an agreement with BLET, aimed at offering up to seven paid sick days per year to BLET members. This deal will offer five new days of paid sick leave per year to Norfolk Southern engineers. Further, it will also provide them the flexibility to use up to two additional days of existing paid time off as sick leave.The deal covers more than 3,300 Norfolk Southern engineers, representing almost 25% of the NS craft workforce. With this agreement, almost all the company's craft employees — approximately 98% — have entered into paid sick leave deals.CSX announced that it has entered into a tentative agreement with the Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers-Transportation Division CSRA (SMART-TD CSRA), aimed at offering paid sick leave benefits. This deal (which is pending ratification by union members) is the 10th one between CSX and its union-represented employees since February. Most of CSX’s unionized workers now have paid sick leave benefits.SMART-TD CSRA represents trainmen, conductors and yardmen on territories of CSX’s Atlanta and West Point railroad, Winston-Salem Southbound railway, Louisville and Nashville railroad, Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway and Seaboard Coast Line railroad.Such agreements reflect the employee-friendly attitude of the railroad companies through which they try to maintain cordial relations with employees and the unions representing them, thereby providing a healthy work atmosphere. These efforts should also help the companies retain and recruit more employees.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year.

2023-06-02,"In the current operating backdrop, the financial sector is deteriorating, given the regional banking crisis and expectations of economic slowdown/recession in the near term.  Hence, solid dividend-yielding stocks should be on investors’ radar. Today, we are discussing one such stock – T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. TROW.Headquartered in Baltimore, MD, T. Rowe Price is a global investment management organization that provides a broad array of mutual funds, sub-advisory services and separate account management for individual and institutional investors, retirement plans and financial intermediaries.TROW has been increasing its quarterly dividend on a regular basis, with the last hike of 1.7% to $1.22 per share announced in February 2023. Also, during the third quarter of 2021, it paid out a special cash dividend of $3 per share. Over the past five years, the company increased dividend five times, with an annualized dividend growth rate of 14.78%.Considering last day’s closing price of $108.38, TROW’s current dividend yield is 4.5%. This is impressive compared with the S&P 500’s average of 1.84% and attractive for investors as it represents a steady income stream.T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. Dividend Yield (TTM) T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. Dividend Yield (TTM)T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. dividend-yield-ttm | T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. Quote Is the TROW stock worth a look to earn a high dividend yield? Let’s check out the company fundamentals to understand risk and rewards. This will help us make a proper investment decision.In the first quarter of 2023, TROW returned around $283.4 million of capital to shareholders, comprising $280.7 million of dividends on common shares and repurchases worth $2.7 million. The share repurchase plan was increased by 10 million shares in 2020, bringing the total authorization to 22.4 million shares.T. Rowe Price has substantial liquidity, which includes total cash and investments of $4.49 billion as of Mar 31, 2023. This will aid sustainable capital deployment activities in the upcoming period.However, per management, share repurchase activity is expected to be reduced in 2023 from 2021 and 2022 levels.T. Rowe Price has scaled business and expanded its operations through numerous acquisitions. In December 2021, it acquired Oak Hill Advisors, L.P. (OHA) to bulk up its offerings in the alternative investment market space.Recently, in April 2023, it acquired Retiree, a fintech firm which provides innovative retirement income planning software. This will expand its existing retirement capabilities, enable a comprehensive suite of retirement income solutions for investors and practitioner tools for financial professionals.Organic growth remains a key strength at T. Rowe Price, with revenues rising over the years. The company also remains focused on enhancing investment capabilities, broadening distribution reach and improving its individual-investor-client experience.Revenue growth has been supported by its diversified assets under management (AUM) across asset classes and client base. TROW has a solid AUM balance which has been growing over the years. However, the trend declined in first-quarter 2023 due to weaker markets.Nonetheless its strong brand, consistent investment track record and decent business volumes will support AUM growth. We estimate AUM balance to grow 3.1% in the current year.On the flip side, T. Rowe Price’s bottom-line growth continues to suffer from rising costs. Also, overdependence on investment advisory fees and U.S. equity assets amid expectations of economic slowdown are concerning. Nonetheless, a solid AUM balance, business diversification and global reach are likely to support TROW’s growth.Over the past three months, shares of TROW have lost 4.5% compared with the industry’s fall of 10.4%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTROW currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Finance Stocks Worth ConsideringA couple of other finance stocks, like Associated Banc-Corp ASB and Invesco Ltd. IVZ, are worth a look as these have robust dividend yields.Considering the last day’s closing price of $15.11 per share, ASB’s current dividend yield is 5.56%. Over the past six months, shares of ASB have lost 34.9%.Based on the last day’s closing price of $14.74 per share, IVZ’s present dividend yield is 5.43%.

2023-06-04,"Becton Dickinson's (NYSE:BDX) stock up by 6.6% over the past three months. We wonder if and what role the company's financials play in that price change as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. In this article, we decided to focus on Becton Dickinson's  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. See our latest analysis for Becton Dickinson How To Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Becton Dickinson is:6.4% = US$1.6b ÷ US$26b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.06 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Becton Dickinson's Earnings Growth And 6.4% ROEWhen you first look at it, Becton Dickinson's ROE doesn't look that attractive. A quick further study shows that the company's ROE doesn't compare favorably to the industry average of 9.8% either. In spite of this, Becton Dickinson was able to grow its net income considerably, at a rate of 25% in the last five years. We reckon that there could be other factors at play here. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Becton Dickinson's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 10% in the same period, which is great to see.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is BDX fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Becton Dickinson Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?The high three-year median payout ratio of 68% (implying that it keeps only 32% of profits) for Becton Dickinson suggests that the company's growth wasn't really hampered despite it returning most of the earnings to its shareholders.Moreover, Becton Dickinson is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to drop to 27% over the next three years. As a result, the expected drop in Becton Dickinson's payout ratio explains the anticipated rise in the company's future ROE to 16%, over the same period.ConclusionOverall, we feel that Becton Dickinson certainly does have some positive factors to consider. That is, quite an impressive growth in earnings. However, the low profit retention means that the company's earnings growth could have been higher, had it been reinvesting a higher portion of its profits. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

The U.S. Department of Energy (""DOE"") named Dow a sub-awardee under X-energy's Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program (""ARDP"") Cooperative Agreement. The JDA provides for up to $50 million in engineering work, up to half of which is eligible to be funded through ARDP, and the other half by Dow.The project is expected to reduce the Seadrift site's emissions by approximately 440,000 MT CO2e/year. Dow and X-energy will now prepare and submit a Construction Permit application to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (""NRC""), an important milestone to bringing the project to fruition. Construction on the four-reactor project is expected to begin in 2026 and to be completed by the end of this decade.Dow's Seadrift site covers 4,700 acres and manufactures more than 4 billion pounds of materials per year used across a wide variety of applications including food packaging and preservation, footwear, wire and cable insulation, solar cell membranes, and packaging for medical and pharmaceutical products.Story continuesX-energy was selected by the DOE in 2020 to develop, license, build, and demonstrate an operational advanced reactor and fuel fabrication facility by the end of the decade. Since that award, X-energy has completed the engineering and basic design of the nuclear reactor, has begun development and licensing of a fuel fabrication facility in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and is now working with Dow to prepare applications to the NRC for Construction Permits at the Seadrift site.Attributable quotes: Jim Fitterling, Dow chairman and CEO""Advanced nuclear has attractive advantages over other sources of clean power, including a compact footprint, competitive cost, and enhanced power and steam reliability. The Seadrift site plays an important role in further advancing Dow's sustainability goals, as evidenced by our increasing growth and investment at the site. We are excited to have the support of our local community, the DOE, and State of Texas as we progress on this important project.""""Our advanced nuclear project is another example of Dow leading the way and showing industry the path toward a lower carbon future. Alongside Dow's key decarbonize and grow projects in Alberta and Terneuzen, as well as our circularity projects around the globe, we are positioned to drive growth by delivering sustainable products.""Clay Sell, X-energy CEO""X-energy will deliver our innovative technology to the Texas Gulf Coast to efficiently and reliably decarbonize the Seadrift Site's heat and power assets. We will showcase the unique versatility and wide range of applications of the Xe-100 advanced small modular nuclear reactor for energy production and manufacturing. This project will serve as a model for how we can decarbonize processes to create the products relied upon by people all over the world.""Governor Greg Abbott, The State of Texas""Texas is the energy capital of the world, and Dow and X-energy's decision to choose Texas as the location for their new SMR nuclear plant is a testament to our state's exceptional business climate and history of innovation in this critical industry,"" said Governor Greg Abbott. ""This SMR project further cements Texas' position as a global energy leader and will bring good-paying jobs and more economic opportunity to hardworking Texans in the Coastal Bend. I look forward to working with Dow and X-energy as we continue to unleash the full potential of our state's mighty energy industry.""Judge Richard Meyer, Calhoun County Judge""We are excited that Dow has chosen its Seadrift site for this innovative technology and investment. Calhoun County welcomes this economic development and we appreciate Dow and X-energy's willingness to engage the community regarding the benefits and safety of the project.""Dow Dow (NYSE:DOW) combines global breadth; asset integration and scale; focused innovation and materials science expertise; leading business positions; and environmental, social and governance leadership to achieve profitable growth and help deliver a sustainable future.

2023-06-10,"Campbell Soup Company (NYSE:CPB) has announced that it will pay a dividend of $0.37 per share on the 31st of July. This makes the dividend yield 3.2%, which will augment investor returns quite nicely. View our latest analysis for Campbell Soup Campbell Soup's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageImpressive dividend yields are good, but this doesn't matter much if the payments can't be sustained. Prior to this announcement, Campbell Soup's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This indicates that quite a large proportion of earnings is being invested back into the business.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 25.9%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 46%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendCampbell Soup Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $1.16, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $1.48. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 2.5% a year over that time. Although we can't deny that the dividend has been remarkably stable in the past, the growth has been pretty muted.Dividend Growth May Be Hard To AchieveThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. Let's not jump to conclusions as things might not be as good as they appear on the surface. Over the past five years, it looks as though Campbell Soup's EPS has declined at around 4.7% a year. A modest decline in earnings isn't great, and it makes it quite unlikely that the dividend will grow in the future unless that trend can be reversed. It's not all bad news though, as the earnings are predicted to rise over the next 12 months - we would just be a bit cautious until this can turn into a longer term trend.Story continuesIn SummaryOverall, a consistent dividend is a good thing, and we think that Campbell Soup has the ability to continue this into the future. While the payments look sustainable for now, earnings have been shrinking so the dividend could come under pressure in the future. This looks like it could be a good dividend stock going forward, but we would note that the payout ratio has been at higher levels in the past so it could happen again.Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. Taking the debate a bit further, we've identified 1 warning sign for Campbell Soup that investors need to be conscious of moving forward. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

The broader Zacks Transportation sector has lost 0.3% in the said time frame.Despite the challenges surrounding the industry, some railroad companies like Union Pacific Corporation and Norfolk Southern Corporation have consistently announced dividend hikes, thus highlighting their pro-shareholder stance.Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these companies have superior fundamentals like a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics.How to Pick Stocks With Solid Dividend Payouts?In order to choose some of the best dividend stocks from the aforementioned industry, we have run the Zacks Stock Screener to identify stocks with a dividend yield in excess of 2% and a sustainable dividend payout ratio of less than 60%.

2023-06-17,"If you want to compound wealth in the stock market, you can do so by buying an index fund. But the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. For example, the Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) share price is up 57% in the last five years, slightly above the market return. It's fair to say the stock has continued its long term trend in the last year, over which it has risen 30%.So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. Check out our latest analysis for Salesforce There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During the last half decade, Salesforce became profitable. That's generally thought to be a genuine positive, so we would expect to see an increasing share price.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthThis free interactive report on Salesforce's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.A Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Salesforce has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 30% in the last twelve months. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 9%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Salesforce that you should be aware of before investing here.Story continuesIf you like to buy stocks alongside management, then you might just love this free list of companies.

2023-06-18,"Let's talk about the popular Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP). The company's shares saw a decent share price growth in the teens level on the NYSE over the last few months. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s take a look at Union Pacific’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. See our latest analysis for Union Pacific What's The Opportunity In Union Pacific?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 13.10% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Union Pacific today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $180.96, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Union Pacific’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What does the future of Union Pacific look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Union Pacific's earnings growth are expected to be in the teens in the upcoming years, indicating a solid future ahead. This should lead to robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in UNP’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on UNP, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.If you want to dive deeper into Union Pacific, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing.

2023-06-22,"(Adds Chevron lawyer's comment in paragraph 5, adds previous comments by industry in paragraph 12)By Clark MindockJune 22 (Reuters) - An Oregon county on Thursday sued Exxon, Chevron, other major oil and coal companies, and industry groups, seeking over $50 billion to counter the harms caused by extreme weather fueled by climate change.Multnomah County said in the lawsuit filed in state court in Portland that fossil fuel companies and trade groups like the American Petroleum Institute intentionally deceived the public about the dangers of burning their products for decades. It said the companies and trade groups must now help pay for past and future harms from the extreme weather that has resulted, including a 2021 heat wave in the Pacific Northwest that killed dozens.Rather than acknowledge the dangers of climate change, the lawsuit said the fossil fuel industry worked to undermine the scientific consensus around the problem ""with pseudo-science, fabricated doubt, and a well-funded, sustained public relations campaign to promote their spin.""The lawsuit also targets the consulting firm McKinsey, which it said advises major oil companies, including on strategies to downplay or deny the link between greenhouse gas emissions and extreme weather.Theodore Boutrous, an attorney for Chevron, said in a statement that lawsuits such as the one filed on Thursday are ""counterproductive"" and distract from advancing effective international policy solutions. He said the county's claims are ""baseless"" and barred by the U.S. Constitution.The American Petroleum Institute and McKinsey did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The county said it had already begun experiencing climate-related harms, including from the 2021 “heat dome” heat wave that caused temperatures in the county, which includes Portland, to soar to 116 Fahrenheit (46.6 Celsius).Since the area normally has mild weather, the lawsuit said residents were not equipped with things like air conditioners to handle the elevated temperatures. The county said 69 people in the county died from overheating and the heat wave caused a ""crushing economic burden.""Story continuesThe heat wave, and other extreme weather events like wildfires, are a ""direct and foreseeable consequence"" of the industry's decision to sell fossil fuels for decades despite knowing their harms, according to the lawsuit.The county is seeking $50 million to repay it for its past efforts to protect public health, safety and property from heat waves and wildfires, at least $1.5 billion for future damages and at least $50 billion for an abatement fund to help study and implement mitigation measures to reduce climate-related harms.The legal action follows dozens of lawsuits filed in recent years against the fossil fuel industry by states and municipalities across the U.S. broadly alleging harms from climate impacts including extreme weather.The American Petroleum Institute and oil companies have said in response to those lawsuits that policies to address climate change should come from the federal executive branch and Congress, not via a patchwork of decisions in court cases across the U.S. (Reporting by Clark Mindock in New York Editing by Alexia Garamfalvi and Matthew Lewis)"
2023-06-23,"OAKLAND, Calif., June 23, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) unveiled a new research, development (R&D) and innovation initiative to bridge the gap between today's energy system and California's electrified and decarbonized future.Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PRNewsfoto/Pacific Gas and Electric Company)The initiative is anchored on PG&E's R&D Strategy Report, available at www.pge.com/innovation. The report identifies nearly 70 priority energy system challenges requiring R&D to achieve PG&E's True North Strategy, which comprises three major components: rebuilding trust and delivering excellent service for customers; architecting a decarbonized, safe, and reliable energy system; and enabling these outcomes by building strong foundational capabilities.PG&E will leverage the report to engage with researchers, industry, policymakers, entrepreneurs, and academia to identify novel technologies and solutions across the electric and gas systems focused on supply and load management, integrated grid planning, electric vehicles and vehicle-to-grid applications, wildfire mitigation, undergrounding, and gas system decarbonization.""PG&E has a rich history of accelerating innovation, and we are more committed than ever to working with the best and the brightest to advance our clean energy future and solve some of the most challenging issues facing the energy system today,"" said Jason Glickman, Executive Vice President, Engineering, Planning & Strategy, PG&E. ""Our new R&D Strategy Initiative provides insights needed for working more collaboratively and effectively with innovators to advance a wide range of bold, innovative technologies that will enhance the customer experience, improve grid resilience, and ensure that a healthy environment and safe, carbon-neutral energy system is the reality for all Californians.""To advance these goals, PG&E, through the new initiative, will proactively identify and utilize emerging technologies that have successfully progressed out of the foundational research phase, are ready to pilot or deploy near-term and have a path to commercialization at scale.Story continuesInnovation Summit 2023 on July 25 and Pitch Fest in SeptemberThrough the R&D Strategy Report, developed in collaboration with ADL Ventures, an energy and climate tech consultancy, PG&E is sharing with the energy industry, technology, and start-up communities key insights around challenges the company is committed to solving with breakthrough thinking and radical collaboration. As next steps in bringing this new R&D Strategy Initiative to life, PG&E will host two events this year:The PG&E Innovation Summit 2023 on July 25 leverages the R&D Strategy Report to bring together entrepreneurs, national labs, thought leaders, policymakers, investors, and other stakeholders to engage directly with PG&E leaders and subject-matter experts about the current state and future needs of the energy system. This inaugural event will include energy industry keynote speakers (to be announced) and deep dive breakout sessions around the key R&D themes outlined in the report. The one-day event will take place in-person in San Ramon and will be hosted by Jason Glickman and Patti Poppe, Chief Executive Officer of PG&E Corporation. There will be a virtual attendance option inclusive of the breakout sessions.The Innovation Pitch Fest 2023 in September will follow the technology and solution application and selection process that opens on July 25. Through that process, select applicants will be invited to pitch their technologies or solutions at the Innovation Pitch Fest 2023 to PG&E management, key decisionmakers and subject-matter experts. Successful pitches have the potential to lead to a range of follow-on engagements with PG&E, including partnership and grant opportunities, and influence over the scoping of upcoming Electric Program Investment Charge (EPIC) 4 projects with a total budget of $83 million. PG&E is actively developing its portfolio of EPIC 4 projects around the key themes outlined in the R&D Strategy Report and anticipates launching projects by the first quarter of 2024, pending final program approval by the California Public Utilities Commission.R&D Strategy Initiative Focus AreasSupply and Load Management – PG&E aspires to play an important role in expanding load management capabilities across all levels of the grid and seeks to partner with the innovation community to make comprehensive load management a core capability. On the supply side, PG&E seeks to integrate promising new forms of next-generation energy supply and storage technologies at the lowest capital cost and highest-value locations to deliver the clean, affordable, and resilient grid of the future.Integrated Grid Planning – Accommodating the pace and scale of anticipated load growth will require the ability to connect new loads more efficiently to the electric system while optimizing transmission and distribution (T&D) upgrades. PG&E seeks to identify new tools and technologies that reduce lead times for service upgrades and new service connections, safely increase the flexibility and/or thermal rating of grid assets, improve power quality on the T&D system or otherwise increase the efficiency of T&D assets on the grid.Electric vehicles and vehicle-to-grid applications – PG&E aims to reduce the costs and shorten the timelines associated with charging installation upgrades through low-cost technologies that can be implemented at scale or solutions that avoid electrical upgrades altogether. Additionally, enabling vehicle-to-everything (V2X) infrastructure and making full use of EVs as grid assets can create opportunities to reduce the cost of ownership and unlock novel value streams that could be leveraged to better serve customers and the grid and generate incremental revenue.Wildfire mitigation – PG&E is continually looking for the most cutting-edge technologies and aggressive methods to mitigate wildfire risk while minimizing customer impacts. Improved monitoring, management, and operation of assets–along with optimized forest management–can help end catastrophic wildfires while enhancing PG&E's ability to deliver affordable and reliable electricity.Undergrounding – PG&E seeks to increase the speed, efficiency, and predictability of undergrounding. The goal is to identify novel technologies that can help PG&E mitigate risk quickly while reducing the cycle time and cost of undergrounding projects.Decarbonizing the gas system – PG&E's vision is to evolve the gas system to be an affordable, safe, and reliable net zero energy delivery platform. To make the transition, PG&E expects a diverse mix of resources to be available—from broad electrification to cleaner fuels such as renewable natural gas and hydrogen to nature-based solutions and carbon capture, storage, and utilization.Read the R&D Strategy Report, find Innovation Summit details and registration information, and learn more about the Innovation Pitch Fest at www.pge.com/innovation.About PG&EPG&E, a subsidiary of PG&E Corporation (NYSE:PCG), is a combined natural gas and electric utility serving more than 16 million people across 70,000 square miles in Northern and Central California.

2023-06-24,"In this piece, we will take a look at 14 best stocks for long term growth. If you want to skip our analysis of the stock market and the driving forces behind it, head on over to 5 Best Stocks for Long Term Growth. The last week of June doesn't appear to have glad tidings for the stock market. The first three weeks of the month saw a slew of data releases from the Labor Department, most of which indicated that the Federal Reserve will now consider taking a slower approach to its current interest rate hiking cycle. Consequently, investors had penciled in a fifty basis point increase for the remainder of this year, with this decision reflected in both foreign currency and stock markets.Yet, the market is still quite jittery from the shocks that it has been dealt with over the past year. The recent jitters felt as June's final week kicks off came after fresh remarks by the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Mr. Jerome Powell to the U.S. Senate. Chair Powell, who discussed a wide ranging series of topics with senators, commented on the role of the central bank during the multiple failures earlier this year, the determinants behind the Fed's decision to raise interest rates, and whether it will increase rates later this year. While Mr. Powell's statements were in line with market expectations, when combined with the latest developments in key sectors of the U.S. economy, there are worries that more trouble might be headed our way.One such sector is the real estate industry. Real estate is highly receptive to interest rate hikes since both builders require access to capital to finance their projects and buyers need loans or mortgages to make costly purchases. Higher rates slow down the market, and since interest rates are at historic highs these days, the real estate sector is feeling the brunt. Not to mention, the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic saw workers shift to home. This trend has persisted, and a fresh report from Capital Economics believes that office buildings in America are unlikely to regain their pre pandemic values until 2040. With this dour backdrop, the worries of a potential recession and if the Fed's ten interest rate hikes since March 2022 are yet to fully make their impact is driving market downs.Story continuesThe talk of a recession in the economy has been going on for nearly a year now. And this talk seems to have returned now, with another Fed official jumping into the debate of future interest rate hikes. In an exclusive interview with Reuters, San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank Mary Daly shared that two additional interest rate hikes are a real probability for the course of this year. Right now, investors are worried that the Fed might have tightened too fast, and Ms. Daly's comments saw them price in a potential recession down in the future into markets today. As of the early afternoon on June 22nd, the S&P 500 was down 0.658%, the NASDAQ 100 had lost 0.89% and the Dow Jones Industrial Index was down 0.54%.However, talk of the Fed raising interest rates more later this year is not a surprise. Therefore, to explain recent downturns in the stock market, we'll have to look elsewhere as well. And this elsewhere is Europe's economic health. Economies of both France and Germany - two of Europe's biggest - shared disappointing data that made investors flee to the safe haven of treasuries. And those in the U.S. followed as they were already spooked by comments from the Fed officials. For U.S. markets, the risks of downfall are even higher as this year's recovery is not sector agnostic; instead, it is focused on a handful of sectors such as artificial intelligence that have provided investors an opportunity to break out from the dour sentiment of 2022.At this point, you might be wondering what were those statements by Chair Powell that once again spooked investors. Well, during his hearing at Senate's Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, he shared:So you know the risk is that we, the reason we've slowed down really since last December we slowed from 75 to 50 basis points per meeting to 25 at every meeting. And now as we reach, as we get closer and closer to what we believe will be our, it's uncertain, we think our destination is, we've slowed down a little further. So we're trying to avoid the mistake of going too far. And that's all it is. It's, as you can see, overwhelmingly, people on the Committee do believe, it will be appropriate to raise hikes one or two additional times. A strong majority believes two times this year if the economy performs as expected.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some great stocks for long term growth, out of which the top picks are UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

2023-06-27,"In this article, we will take a look at the 10 Martin Shkreli stock picks and their performance. To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Martin Shkreli Stock Picks and Their Performance.Martin Shkreli a.k.a. ""Pharma Bro"" is known for a variety of reasons, many of which are tinged with notoriety. He cofounded MSMB Capital Management (a company that specializes in long-term investments in healthcare and biotechnology businesses); he is the former CEO and Co-founder of Retrophin; and also the former CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals and KaloBios Pharmaceuticals Inc.Shkreli faced criticism in 2015 for significantly increasing the price of the HIV medication Daraprim, which was considered essential for saving lives. The cost of the drug jumped from approximately $13.50 to a staggering $750 overnight. This price surge came after the FDA approved the decades-old drug for treating toxoplasmosis, a major contributor to focal central nervous system disease in individuals with AIDS. Shkreli was charged and convicted on two counts of securities fraud and one count of conspiring to commit securities fraud. He was later sentenced to 7 years of jail time and up to $7.4 million in fines.Martin Shkreli started MSMB Capital Management in 2009 together with his friend Marek Biestek where they shorted biotech companies and spread the flaws of these companies to investors and to the public.In 2011, under the MSMB umbrella, he founded Retrophin, a portfolio company that focused on biotechnology to create treatments for rare diseases. He was ousted as the company's CEO because of committing stock-trading irregularities and other violations of securities rules. Retrophin was rebranded as Travere Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:TVTX) in an effort to further distance the company from Shkreli.After his stint with Retrophin, he founded Turing Pharmaceuticals in 2015 where the controversy over the Daraprim price started. Shkreli also led an investor group in November 2015 and acquired a majority stake in KaloBios Pharmaceuticals. He was chosen to be CEO of the company but was then terminated after his arrest on December 2015.Story continuesShkreli was subpoenaed to appear before the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform of the U.S. House of Representatives to answer questions about the Daraprim price increase, but he followed his lawyer's advice and refused to answer any questions during the hearings.Charges were filed against Shkreli and he was arrested in December 2015 after an investigation into his tenure at MSMB Capital Management and Retrophin.On August 4, 2017, the trial jury found Shkreli guilty of two counts of securities fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud. Shkreli described his prosecution as ""a witch hunt of epic proportions"". He was sentenced to 7-year imprisonment and to forfeit more than $7.3 million of his assets. Martin Shkreli was also ordered to pay a civil fine of $64.6 million to compensate victims. However, he was granted an early release from the low-security federal prison in Allenwood, Pennsylvania, on May 18, 2022.Martin Shkreli revealed his latest AI tool, named ""Dr. Gupta,"" on Twitter earlier this year. During a Twitter Spaces event, Shkreli shared that his new large language model was trained using data sourced from online medical journals which can be found on the web.Martin Shkreli Stock Picks and Their PerformanceBy House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform - https://www.flickr.com/photos/oversight/25044779546/in/photostream/, Public Domain, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=54893482Our MethodologyFor this article we picked stocks Shkreli gave positive comments about on Reddit and YouTube. Five years ago, Shkreli engaged in an AMA on Reddit, during which he discussed certain stocks that he held a positive outlook on. We selected a few stocks from that particular thread. We also saw several videos posted by Martin Shkreli on his YouTube channel in which he analyzes stocks. We only picked companies he's bullish on. That does not necessarily mean Shkreli has stakes in these companies.Martin Shkreli Stock Picks and Their Performance10. AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (NYSE:AMC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 161-Year Stock Performance: -71%AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (NYSE:AMC) is actively involved in the business of theatrical exhibitions, utilizing its subsidiary companies to carry out its operations in this field.As of the end of the past quarter of 2023, 16 hedge funds had stakes in AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (NYSE:AMC). The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (NYSE:AMC) during the latest period was Philippe Laffont's Coatue Management which owns 4,212,158 shares of the company worth $21 million.Martin Shkreli mentioned AMC in one of his YouTube streams and explained why he thinks AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (NYSE:AMC) is a great investment choice. Here's what he said:""I actually think AMC gets a good deal. The fact that they get all this margin just on the film, and then 80% margin on food and beverage. It's not a bad business. It's a pretty good business model. It's pretty capital-intensive. They actually have buying power too, whereas other theaters don't have as much buying power.""9. Sony Corporation (NYSE:SONY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 301-Year Stock Performance: +6.98%Tokyo, Japan-based Sony Corporation (NYSE:SONY) is an electric equipment designer, music producer, and game developer.Earlier this year, Martin Shkreli mentioned Sony Corporation (NYSE:SONY) in one of his YouTube streams and said:“The company made $1.1 trillion in cash in 2021, and made $1.2 trillion in cash in 2022. The market cap is about $15 trillion. So would you pay $15 trillion to get $1.2 trillion a year? Possibly a growing $1.2 trillion a year. That seems pretty good but is it free cash flow or not? Sony has clearly cash flow potential of a trillion in a year, which in a current market cap of $15 trillion sounds pretty good for a slow grower. Its average growth is 5%, so earning should grow to 7% with little leverage. Music is their best division from a profitability perspective and arguably music doesn’t quite give games a run for its money but pound for pound it certainly does. Music plus imaging is actually bigger than games in terms of profit. My verdict on SONY is its okay. It’s not something to write home about but it could be an “okay” stock if it gets cheaper. It’s certainly worth paying attention to given their status in the ecosystem of several different spheres of influence.”8. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 541-Year Stock Performance: 28%Five years ago Shkreli did an AMA session on Reddit in which he mentioned some stocks he was long on. REGN was one of these stocks. Over the past five years REGN shares have gained 124%.As of the end of the first quarter of 2023, 54 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN). The total value of these stakes was $1.9 billion. The most significant stakeholder of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) during this period was Citadel Investment Group of Ken Griffin which owns a $239.3 million stake in the company.7. BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (NASDAQ:BMRN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 561-Year Stock Performance: +8%BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (NASDAQ:BMRN) specializes in the advancement and distribution of treatments designed for individuals grappling with severe and potentially fatal uncommon illnesses and medical conditions. BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (NASDAQ:BMRN)'s main business market includes specialty pharmacies, and hospitals, as well as distributors, and pharmaceutical wholesalers across the United States, Europe, Latin America, and other global regions.As of the end of the past quarter of 2023, 56 hedge funds had stakes in BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (NASDAQ:BMRN). The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (NASDAQ:BMRN) during the latest period was Kurt Von Emster's VenBio Select Advisor which owns a $383.6 million stake in the company.Martin Shkreli thinks that BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (NASDAQ:BMRN) is quite attractive regardless of how Valrox, a drug they developed for gene therapy for the treatment of hemophilia A, will perform. Here's what he said:""BMRN appears attractive given limited downside regardless of valrox performance. Valrox likely will do well for at least a few years. A next-generation product will be needed. It's unclear competition will do a lot better than valrox, but that's the main risk.""6. Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 601-Year Stock Performance: +21%Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) is a biopharmaceutical enterprise grounded in research that concentrates on finding, developing, and marketing pioneering medications. Shkreli in a Reddit AMA five years ago said that he was long GILD. The stock has gained about 7% over the past 5 years.Ariel Global Strategy made the following comment about Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Biopharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD. advanced in the quarter on positive data released in a study evaluating Trodelvy versus comparative chemotherapy in patients with metastatic breast cancer. The detailed findings increased investor confidence the drug would receive incremental approvals for a broader range of breast cancer treatments. Shares also received a boost on news the TAF patent portfolio for HIV drugs will be extended from the middle of this decade through the early 2030s, creating greater visibility into the company’s long-term opportunity in the virology market.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Martin Shkreli Stock Picks and Their Performance. Suggested articles:16 Largest Grocery Chains in the World25 Cheapest Countries in the WorldKevin O'Leary’s Stock Portfolio: 10 Stock Picks for 2023Disclosure: None. 10 Martin Shkreli Stock Picks and Their Performance is originally published on Insider Monkey."
2023-06-28,"Moderna (MRNA) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this biotechnology company have returned -6.4%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry, which Moderna falls in, has lost 0.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Moderna is expected to post a loss of $3.97 per share, indicating a change of -175.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -4.6% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of -$3.16 points to a change of -115.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -11.4%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of -$4 indicates a change of -26.7% from what Moderna is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +9.3%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Moderna is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Moderna, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $288.81 million indicates a year-over-year change of -93.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $6.47 billion and $6.87 billion estimates indicate -66.4% and +6.3% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryModerna reported revenues of $1.86 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -69.3%. EPS of $0.19 for the same period compares with $8.58 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.16 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +60.08%. The EPS surprise was +110.73%.Over the last four quarters, Moderna surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Moderna is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Moderna. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

2023-06-29,"CINCINNATI (AP) — Former Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder was sentenced Thursday to 20 years in prison for his role in the largest corruption scandal in state history and taken immediately into custody, a judge declaring that “the court and the community's patience with Larry Householder has expired.”The 64-year-old Republican tensed only slightly as U.S. District Judge Timothy Black meted out the punishment, the maximum under the law, and appeared somewhat disoriented as U.S. Marshals placed him in handcuffs. He glanced back briefly at his wife, Taundra, who exited the courtroom with his Perry County Ducks Unlimited ball cap folded in her hands.Ahead of his sentencing, Householder stood before Black to make a personal appeal for leniency, saying it was not himself that a harsh prison sentence would hurt most but his spouse of 40 years, his sons, grandchildren and friends.“I wasn't power hungry. I went home,” he said of his departure from the Ohio House between speakerships. Householder told the judge that he and his wife had given “every ounce of energy we have to make life better for others.”In a blistering rebuke, Black threw back at Householder evidence counter to the family man image he had presented. He quoted Householder's own statements, presented at trial, saying: “If you’re going to f—- with me, I’m going to f—- with your kids,” “we can f— with him later” and “f—- him ’til he’s dead.”Black called Householder “a bully with a lust for power” whose scheme marked an “assault on democracy, the betrayal of everyone in Ohio.” That included the Ohioans who donated to, campaigned for and voted for Householder, the judge said.“That wasn't their way of just saying I like you or I support you. What they were saying is I'm choosing to trust you,” said Black. “They trusted you to do right by them, and you betrayed their trust.”Householder and lobbyist Matt Borges, a former chair of the Ohio Republican Party, were both convicted in March of a single racketeering charge each, after a six-week trial. Borges is set to be sentenced Friday.Story continuesJurors found that Householder orchestrated and Borges participated in a $60 million bribery scheme secretly funded by Akron-based FirstEnergy Corp. to secure Householder’s power, elect his allies, pass legislation containing a $1 billion bailout for two aging nuclear power plants owned by a FirstEnergy affiliate and then to use a dirty tricks campaign to stifle a ballot effort to overturn the bill.Federal prosecutors had recommended Householder receive 16 to 20 years, holding in a sentencing memo that he “acted as the quintessential mob boss, directing the criminal enterprise from the shadows and using his casket carriers to execute the scheme.” That strategy, they said, gave Householder ”plausible deniability.”His own attorneys had recommended just 12 to 18 months, reporting to the judge that he is “a broken man” who has been “humiliated and disgraced” by the ordeal of his widely reported arrest, high-profile prosecution and seven-week trial by jury.Outside the courthouse Thursday, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio Ken Parker said the government was grateful for the judge's sentence.“We heard Mr. Householder indicate that he keeps close his faith, his family and his friends. I would have added one more: He needs to keep close the Ohioans, if he is going to serve this state. That's what he left out,” Parker said. “That's why he was here today and that's why the judge imposed the highest level of accountability under the statute.”Rachel Belz, CEO of the government watchdog group Ohio Citizen Action, expressed hope that Householder’s sentence would help restore public trust and allow the voice of the people to be “heard and valued” by decision makers.“Democracy does not allow our leaders to wield power without the opportunity for the people to exercise a check on that power,” she said in a statement.Householder was one of Ohio’s most powerful politicians, a historically twice-elected speaker, before his indictment. After his July 2020 arrest, the Republican-controlled House ousted him from his leadership post, but he refused to resign for nearly a year on grounds he was innocent until proven guilty. In a bipartisan vote, representatives ultimately ousted him from the chamber in 2021 — the first such expulsion in Ohio in 150 years.All told, five people and a dark money group have been charged so far for their roles in the scheme. A federal investigation remains ongoing.During the trial, the prosecution called two of the people arrested — Juan Cespedes and Jeff Longstreth, who both pleaded guilty and are cooperating — to testify about political contributions they said were not ordinary, but rather bribes intended to secure passage of the bailout legislation. Generation Now, the 501(c) nonprofit through which much of the money flowed, also has pleaded guilty to racketeering.Cespedes and Longstreth face up to six months in prison each under their plea deals. Neither has been sentenced.The last person arrested, the late Statehouse superlobbyist Neil Clark, was heard on tape in the courtroom. Clark had pleaded not guilty before dying by suicide in March 2021.All the alleged members of the conspiracy benefited personally from the scheme, using sums that an FBI agent described colloquially as “bags of cash” from FirstEnergy. Householder spent around $500,000 of FirstEnergy money to settle a business lawsuit, pay attorneys, deal with expenses at his Florida home and pay off credit card debt. Another $97,000 was used to pay staff and expenses for his 2018 reelection campaign."
2023-06-30,"As the first half of 2023 comes to an end, it’s been a clearly challenging time for stocks, and real estate investment trusts (REITs) in particular, with Federal Reserve rate hikes and hints of recession to come. More than half of all REITs have had negative total returns so far.But some REITs have done quite well as earnings have improved or analysts have raised their positions. Acquisitions have played a part as well in some of the best performances. Take a look at the best REITs over the first half of 2023. Although the top two are mortgage REITs (mREITs), the rest are spread across a broad base of subsectors:Angel Oak Mortgage REIT Inc. (NYSE: AOMR) is an Atlanta-based mREIT that specializes in offering wholesale nonqualified mortgage loans for borrowers who don’t fit traditional lending guidelines.Following a terrible 2022 in which Angel Oak Mortgage had a total return (including dividends) of negative 61.9%, Angel Oak turned it around to lead all REITs so far in 2023 with a 64.35% total return. About two-thirds of that return occurred in January when mREITs and other financial services companies bounced higher from extremely oversold levels.Angel Oak’s performance has been surprising, considering its first-quarter earnings of negative $0.37 was $0.57 below analysts’ expectations and far below its first-quarter 2022 results. This was also the second consecutive quarter of 2023 in which Angel Oak missed the estimates.Despite this, analysts have been looking for a rebound in mREITs. On May 8, Wells Fargo analyst Donald Fandetti maintained his Overweight position on Angel Oak and raised the price target from $8 to $9.Another boost for Angel Oak shares came in early April when it announced the appointment of Manmohan “Manu” Singh as group chief financial officer, succeeding Tracy Jackson, who retired after 12 years with Angel Oak Mortgage REIT.Arlington Asset Investment Corp. (NYSE: AAIC) is a McLean, Virginia-based mREIT that focuses on investing in mortgage-related assets and residential real estate. It allocates capital between agency mortgage-backed securities, mortgage servicing right-related assets, credit investments and single-family residential properties.Story continuesOn May 30, Arlington Asset Investment agreed to a merger with Ellington Financial Inc. (NYSE: EFC), which made Arlington’s shares soar from $2.75 to $4.06 in one day. But Arlington has climbed another 11% since then.Arlington Asset’s total return is the second highest among REITs in 2023 at 53.2%.Life Storage Inc. (NYSE: LSI) is a Buffalo, New York-based self-storage REIT with 1,200 facilities encompassing 68 million square feet across 37 states and Washington, D.C.After turning down an offer to be acquired by Public Storage (NYSE: PSA) in February, Life Storage agreed to a superior offer from Extra Space Storage Inc. (NYSE: EXR) in early April.In May, Life Storage reported quarterly funds from operations (FFO) that were 6.94% higher than FFO in the first quarter of 2022 and revenue that beat the first-quarter 2022 number by 17.18%.Life Storage has a total 2023 return of 38.75%.EPR Properties (NYSE: EPR) is a Kansas City, Missouri-based diversified experiential REIT that owns and operates 363 movie theater chains, amusement parks, ski resorts, fitness centers and other recreational venues across 44 states.Many pundits wrote off EPR Properties this year, saying there was too much risk of default among its movie theater chains for it to prosper. But so far, EPR Properties has proven them wrong. In late April, first-quarter FFO of $1.26 per share and revenue of $171.4 million were both well above analysts’ expectations. Finally, in June, EPR Properties received some positive recognition, when JMP Securities upgraded it from Market Perform to Market Outperform and Keybanc Capital Markets upgraded it from Sector Weight to Overweight.EPR Properties has a total year-to-date return of 29.32%.Tanger Factory Outlet Centers Inc. (NYSE: SKT) is a Greensboro, North Carolina-based retail REIT that owns 37 indoor shopping centers and outdoor factory outlet malls with 14 million square feet and over 2,700 stores across 20 states and Canada.In April, Tanger Factory Outlet Centers raised its quarterly dividend by 11.3% from $0.22 to $0.245 per share. Two weeks later, Tanger reported first-quarter FFO and revenue that beat the Street estimates and raised its guidance for full-year FFO.Tanger has performed quite well in 2023 with a 243.07% return.Welltower Inc. (NYSE: WELL) is a healthcare REIT with 2,008 healthcare properties in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. The properties are a mix of senior housing, medical offices and skilled nursing or post-acute care sectors.On June 6, Welltower announced it was raising its 2023 Normalized FFO guidance from $3.39-$3.54 to $3.43-$3.56. Despite this, on June 23, Raymond James analyst Jonathan Hughes downgraded Welltower from Strong Buy to Outperform, yet raised his price target from $82 to $90.Welltower’s total return so far in 2023 is 21.1%.Plymouth Industrial REIT Inc. (NYSE: PLYM) is a Boston-based industrial REIT that owns and operates 210 properties with over 34 million square feet in 13 East Coast and Midwestern markets. In 2023, Plymouth has outshined larger and more well-known industrial REITs such as Prologis Inc. (NYSE: PLD) and Rexford Industrial Realty Inc. (NYSE: REXR) with some very positive developments.Plymouth Industrial’s total occupancy at the end of 2022 was 99%, and its rent collection was 99.7%, both outstanding numbers. It’s had some positive developments this year:In February, Plymouth Industrial hiked its dividend from $0.22 to $0.225 per share. In April, Plymouth announced it was raising its first-quarter rental rates by 15.9%. In May, Plymouth reported FFO of $0.45 that beat estimates by a penny, while revenue of $49.4 million beat the Street view by $1.84 million and was 15.4% better than revenue of $43.81 million in the first quarter of 2022.Over the first half of the year, Plymouth Industrial REIT has had a total return of 21.03%.Weekly REIT Report: REITs are one of the most misunderstood investment options, making it difficult for investors to spot incredible opportunities until it’s too late.

2023-07-01,"Newell Brands Inc. (NASDAQ:NWL) shareholders should be happy to see the share price up 11% in the last week. But don't envy holders -- looking back over 5 years the returns have been really bad. The share price has failed to impress anyone , down a sizable 68% during that time. So is the recent increase sufficient to restore confidence in the stock? Not yet. But it could be that the fall was overdone.While the last five years has been tough for Newell Brands shareholders, this past week has shown signs of promise. So let's look at the longer term fundamentals and see if they've been the driver of the negative returns. Check out our latest analysis for Newell Brands To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During five years of share price growth, Newell Brands moved from a loss to profitability. However, it made a loss in the last twelve months, suggesting profit may be an unreliable metric at this stage. Other metrics may better explain the share price move.Revenue is actually up 0.5% over the time period. So it seems one might have to take closer look at the fundamentals to understand why the share price languishes. After all, there may be an opportunity.The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-and-revenue-growthIt's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. If you are thinking of buying or selling Newell Brands stock, you should check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Newell Brands the TSR over the last 5 years was -60%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market gained around 16% in the last year, Newell Brands shareholders lost 53% (even including dividends). However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 10% over the last half decade. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Take risks, for example - Newell Brands has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.Newell Brands is not the only stock insiders are buying.

2023-07-02,"By buying an index fund, you can roughly match the market return with ease. But if you choose individual stocks with prowess, you can make superior returns. For example, the Xylem Inc. (NYSE:XYL) share price is up 72% in the last three years, clearly besting the market return of around 35% (not including dividends). On the other hand, the returns haven't been quite so good recently, with shareholders up just 45% , including dividends .Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. Check out our latest analysis for Xylem While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Xylem was able to grow its EPS at 1.0% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. This EPS growth is lower than the 20% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that, as the business progressed over the last few years, it gained the confidence of market participants. That's not necessarily surprising considering the three-year track record of earnings growth. This optimism is also reflected in the fairly generous P/E ratio of 54.68.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthDive deeper into Xylem's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Xylem's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Xylem the TSR over the last 3 years was 78%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Xylem shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 45% over one year. And that does include the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 12% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Xylem better, we need to consider many other factors. To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with Xylem .If you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

2023-07-04,"By buying an index fund, you can roughly match the market return with ease. But if you buy good businesses at attractive prices, your portfolio returns could exceed the average market return.

On the other hand, the returns haven't been quite so good recently, with shareholders up just 6.4% , including dividends .After a strong gain in the past week, it's worth seeing if longer term returns have been driven by improving fundamentals.

One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During three years of share price growth, Capital One Financial achieved compound earnings per share growth of 41% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 21% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore, it seems the market has moderated its expectations for growth, somewhat.

2023-07-05,"Opzelura® is the first approved treatment in the United Kingdom (UK) to address repigmentation in non-segmental vitiligoPhase 3 data supporting the approval show treatment with ruxolitinib cream resulted in improved facial and total body repigmentation, sustained and continued improvements with longer duration of treatmentVitiligo affects around 1 in 100 people in the UKLEATHERHEAD, England, July 05, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Incyte Biosciences UK today announced that the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has granted marketing authorisation for Opzelura® (ruxolitinib) cream 15mg/g for the treatment of non-segmental vitiligo with facial involvement in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age. Opzelura is the first and only approved treatment in the United Kingdom (UK) to offer eligible patients with non-segmental vitiligo support for repigmentation. The MHRA decision follows the European Commission approval1 earlier in April.""Today’s MHRA approval is welcome news for dermatologists and people with vitiligo seeking treatment who until now have had limited options. The data supporting this approval demonstrate the potential for ruxolitinib cream to make a difference in the lives of people living with this condition,"" said Dr. Viktoria Eleftheriadou, Consultant Dermatologist & Lead for Vitiligo Clinic and Research, Walsall Healthcare NHS Trust and The Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust.Vitiligo is a chronic autoimmune disease in which areas of skin depigment or lose their colour due the progressive destruction of pigment-producing cells known as melanocytes2. Around 1 in 100 people in the UK develop vitiligo3,4 with approximately 8 in 10 patients suffering from non-segmental vitiligo, where both sides of the body are affected by symmetrical white patches5. Vitiligo can occur at any age, although many patients with vitiligo will experience initial onset before the age of 304, and have a significant impact on people living with the condition6.Story continues""While more and more people are proud of their vitiligo, there are still so many people who don’t feel comfortable in their skin,"" said Emma Rush, Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Vitiligo Support UK. ""This new treatment option provides a choice for those who wish to treat their condition.""The MHRA decision is based on data from two pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials (TRuE-V1 [NCT04052425] and TRuE-V2 [NCT04057573]), evaluating the efficacy and safety of ruxolitinib cream versus vehicle (non-medicated cream) in more than 600 people with non-segmental vitiligo, age 12 and older7. Results from the TRuE-V program showed that treatment with ruxolitinib cream resulted in significant improvements in facial and total body repigmentation versus vehicle as shown by the number of patients reaching the facial and total body Vitiligo Area Scoring Index (F-VASI-T-VASI) endpoints at Week 24 compared to vehicle and in an open-label extension at Week 527.Results at Week 24, which were consistent across both studies, showed that 29.8% and 30.9% of patients treated with ruxolitinib cream achieved ≥75% improvement from baseline in the facial Vitiligo Area Scoring Index (F-VASI75), the primary endpoint, compared to 7.4% and 11.4% of patients treated with vehicle in TRuE-V1 and TRuE-V2, respectively7. At Week 52, approximately one in two of ruxolitinib cream-treated patients achieved F-VASI757. Additionally, at Week 52, approximately one in three of ruxolitinib cream-treated patients achieved ≥90% improvement from baseline in F-VASI (F-VASI90)7.There were no serious treatment-related adverse events related to ruxolitinib cream and the most common adverse reaction was application site acne7.For additional information, please consult the full Summary of Product Characteristics.""We are delighted to announce the MHRA approval of Opzelura for people living with non-segmental vitiligo with facial involvement,"" said Peter Williams, General Manager, Incyte United Kingdom and Ireland. ""We are now working in partnership with the NHS to ensure that eligible patients seeking to treat their vitiligo are able to access this innovative medicine.""""A new treatment specifically approved for vitiligo in the UK is a significant milestone and furthers our goal at The Vitiligo Society to support, inspire and educate people about vitiligo,"" said John Dunster, Chairperson, The Vitiligo Society.About Opzelura® (ruxolitinib) Cream 15mg/gRuxolitinib cream, a novel formulation of Incyte’s selective JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib, is the first and only topical JAK inhibitor approved for use in the UK indicated for the treatment of non-segmental vitiligo with facial involvement in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age7.In eligible patients, ruxolitinib cream is approved for topical use twice daily to the depigmented skin areas up to a maximum of 10% body surface area7. Satisfactory repigmentation may require treatment with ruxolitinib cream for more than 24 weeks7.Ruxolitinib cream is approved in the European Union for the treatment of non-segmental vitiligo with facial involvement in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age.In the United States, ruxolitinib cream is approved for the topical treatment of non-segmental vitiligo in patients 12 years of age and older.

2023-07-06,"In this article, we discuss the 10 best natural gas stocks to buy now. To skip the detailed analysis of the natural gas industry, you can go directly to the 5 Best Natural Gas Stocks to Buy Now.Natural gas is one of the most used energy sources in the world. In the US alone, it accounted for 32% of the energy consumption in 2021, and in the electricity sector, it accounted for 36% of the U.S. primary energy production.In 2022, fuel prices including natural gas peaked due to the Russia-Ukraine war which led to sanctions on Russia, resulting in pressure on European and global gas markets. However, due to favorable weather conditions and actions taken by the governments, the pressure on the market eased a little since the beginning of 2023. In Europe, natural gas consumption fell by almost 55 billion cubic meters year-over-year during the 2022/2023 heating season, marking the steepest decline in consumption for any recorded winter season. Furthermore, to avoid further pressures due to the cut-off from Russian exports, the European Union has also unveiled a 210 billion euro plan to completely be rid of Russian fossil fuel dependence by 2027. Compared to 2022, the Russian pipeline gas consumption is expected to drop around 45% in 2023. Nevertheless, In Asia and the Middle East, the natural gas demand is expected to increase by 3% and 2%, respectively, The higher demand from these regions will offset most of the drop in demand from Europe and the US in 2023 which is expected to decline by 5% and 2%, respectively. In the first quarter of 2023, the natural gas average price at Henry Hub was $2.55 per Metric Million British Thermal Units (MMBtu), which showed an almost 40% YoY decline and a 57% sequential decline. The natural gas price was $4.55 per MMBtu in Q1 2022 and $5.92 per MMBtu in the fourth quarter of 2022. Between mid-December and the first quarter of 2023, natural gas prices dropped by around 70% in Northeast Asian, North American, and European markets.Story continuesThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) released its short-term energy outlook on June 6 which reveals that the US natural gas production set a monthly record in April with 104 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) production. In the previous month, it was 102 billion cubic feet per day. The EIA expects natural gas production to average around 103 Bcfd in the second half of 2023. According to the EIA’s outlook, natural gas prices are expected to remain conservative in the second half of the year too with an estimated $2.60 per MMBtu average price in the third quarter of 2023. One of the main reasons for these low prices is overstocked inventory. In May, natural gas storage inventories were 15% above the 5-year average.Despite having a rough time, natural gas prices can still increase over time as it has been a key source of fuel in reducing global carbon emissions. On top of that, if a dry or hotter-than-usual summer comes along and gets followed by a cold winter, the commodity can experience high price volatility. On June 26, natural gas futures to their peak in two months and have since dropped by 6.8% on June 30.Even though natural gas prices are under pressure due to several factors, the commodity is still expected to play a huge role in the energy industry until renewable energy completely takes over fossil fuels. Due to low prices, natural gas stocks are also experiencing a decline in their stock prices. To take advantage of the situation, Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) are some of the best stocks to look out for.10 Best Natural Gas Stocks to Buy Nowvovan/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyFor this article, we chose the natural gas companies according to their hedge fund sentiment as of the first quarter of 2022.

2023-07-09,"News Corporation (NASDAQ:NWSA) saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s take a look at News’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for News What Is News Worth?Great news for investors – News is still trading at a fairly cheap price. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $31.16, but it is currently trading at US$19.71 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. Although, there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because News’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company's shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.What does the future of News look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for News. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since NWSA is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on NWSA for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its prosperous future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy NWSA.

2023-07-10,"Services activity in the United States increased for the sixth consecutive month in June, indicating a steady rebound.

2023-07-11,"Nucor (NUE) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this steel company have returned +10.6%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Steel - Producers industry, which Nucor falls in, has gained 7.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Nucor is expected to post earnings of $5.54 per share, indicating a change of -42.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.8% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $18.42 points to a change of -36% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +4.6%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.09 indicates a change of -34.3% from what Nucor is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Nucor.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Nucor, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $9.76 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -17.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $36.04 billion and $32.88 billion estimates indicate -13.2% and -8.8% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNucor reported revenues of $8.71 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -17%. EPS of $4.45 for the same period compares with $7.67 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.5 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.45%. The EPS surprise was +16.8%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Nucor is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nucor. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

2023-07-12,"By David Carnevali and Svea Herbst-BaylissNEW YORK (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley has hired veteran investment banker Daniel Cohen from Truist Financial Corp, where he was the head of the firm's healthcare services advisory business, a person familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.In his new role, Cohen will continue to focus on dealmaking in the pharmaceutical services sector, the person said, requesting anonymity because the move is not yet public.Morgan Stanley declined to comment. A Truist spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and Cohen did not immediately reply to a message sent via LinkedIn.Cohen's hire comes after veteran pharmaceutical industry bankers Arek Kurkciyan and Dennis Crandall left Morgan Stanley last year to join Moelis & Co.Cohen spent just over one year at Truist, where he served as the head of pharmaceutical services investment banking and healthcare sponsor coverage, before being elevated as the head of the healthcare services unit, according to his LinkedIn profile.Earlier, he served as global head of healthcare services investment banking at RBC Capital Markets, his profile shows, with prior investment banking roles at Oppenheimer Holdings Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co.Cohen took a break from investment banking in 2010, when he joined life sciences firm Catalent Inc in a business development role, his LinkedIn says.Morgan Stanley's global M&A franchise is currently led by John Collins, who previously served as global head of healthcare investment banking at the bank.In the Americas, sole leadership of Morgan Stanley's M&A franchise is being passed on to Tom Miles, who co-headed the business with Brian Healy. Healy announced plans to retire in August, according to an internal memo sent to employees in June.(Reporting by David Carnevali and Svea Herbst-Bayliss in New York; Editing by Emma Rumney)"
2023-07-13,"Investors in Cincinnati Financial Corporation CINF need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Dec 15, 2023 $50.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Cincinnati Financial shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Cincinnati Financial is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Insurance - Property and Casualty  industry that ranks in the Bottom 24% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, one analyst has increased the earnings estimates for the current quarter, while two have revised their estimates downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 91 cents per share to 77 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Cincinnati Financial right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

2023-07-14,"Philip Morris International Inc. PM is likely to register top-line growth when it reports second-quarter 2023 earnings on Jul 20. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $8,688 million, suggesting growth of 10.9% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the bottom line has declined by a penny in the past seven days to $1.47 per share. The projection indicates a decrease of 0.7% from the figure reported in the year-ago period quarter. Philip Morris has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 10.4%, on average.Factors to ConsiderPhilip Morris has been benefiting from its strong pricing power, which has aided its revenues and adjusted operating income. Though higher pricing might lead to a possible decline in cigarette consumption, it is seen that smokers tend to absorb price increases due to the addictive quality of cigarettes.Philip Morris International Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurprisePhilip Morris International Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Philip Morris International Inc. QuoteHigher pricing variance was an upside to the company’s performance (mainly due to increased combustible tobacco pricing) in the first quarter of 2023. The continuation of this trend is likely to aid results in the second quarter.With reduced-risk products (RRPs) gaining popularity, Philip Morris is also benefiting from its business transformation, with smoke-free products generating 34.9% of the company’s net revenues in the first quarter of 2023. PM is well-placed toward becoming a majority smoke-free company by 2025. To this end, the company’s IQOS, a heat-not-burn device, counts among one of the leading RRPs in the industry.Total IQOS users at the end of the first quarter were estimated at roughly 25.8 million (of which nearly 18.5 million had switched to IQOS and stopped smoking). For 2023, management expects heated tobacco unit (HTU) shipment volumes of 125-130 billion units. These factors bode well for the quarter to be reported.However, cigarette volumes, in general, have been affected by consumers’ rising health consciousness and a shift to low-risk tobacco alternatives. In 2023, the total international industry volume is estimated to decline by 1-2%, excluding China and the United States.  Total cigarette and HTU shipment volume growth is likely to come in the range of around flat to an increase of 1%.Apart from this, the company has been battling cost-related headwinds for a while now. In the first quarter of 2023, the adjusted operating income tumbled 10.7% on an organic basis due to elevated marketing, administration and research costs, an adverse volume/mix and escalated manufacturing costs, partly compensated by favorable pricing variance. Management expects certain margin pressures in the first half of 2023.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Philip Morris this time.

2023-07-15,"Over the past year, many Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for Broadcom The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At BroadcomIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the President, Hock Tan, sold US$19m worth of shares at a price of US$626 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$889). As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. This single sale was just 12% of Hock Tan's stake.Insiders in Broadcom didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insiders At Broadcom Have Sold Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Broadcom. Specifically, insiders ditched US$6.1m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesInsider OwnershipAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Broadcom insiders own about US$5.4b worth of shares (which is 1.5% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At Broadcom Tell Us?Insiders haven't bought Broadcom stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. But it is good to see that Broadcom is growing earnings. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 3 warning signs for Broadcom you should know about.Of course Broadcom may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of high quality companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

2023-07-20,"Bright Minds Biosciences-- BMB-101 is a highly selective and potent 5-HT2C agonist being developed for the treatment of refractory epilepsies and other indications, such as psychosis, addiction, and impulse control disorders-- BMB-101 demonstrated an excellent safety and tolerability profile in single ascending dose, multiple ascending dose and food effects study-- BMB-101 demonstrated central target engagement and predictable plasma pharmacokineticsVANCOUVER, British Columbia, July 20, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bright Minds Biosciences Inc. (CSE:DRUG) (NASDAQ:DRUG) (“Bright Minds” or the “Company”), a biotechnology company focused on developing novel drugs for the targeted treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders and refractory epilepsy, today announced the successful completion of its three-part Phase 1 study of BMB-101. The study, conducted in Adelaide, Australia, by CMAX Clinical Research, a clinical trial center specializing in a range of early-phase trials and first-in-human studies, evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK), and food effect in healthy volunteers.BMB-101 is a highly selective and potent 5-HT2C agonist being developed for the treatment of refractory epilepsies and other indications, such as psychosis, addiction, and impulse control disorders. BMB-101 demonstrated an excellent safety and tolerability profile. 5-HT2C target engagement was demonstrated by transient, dose-dependent increases in prolactin. BMB-101 exhibited predictable plasma pharmacokinetics with relatively small inter-individual variability. The current formulation allows for twice-a-day oral dosing, and with further formulation development, there may be potential for once-a-day dosing. Based on these observations, the Company believes that moderate doses of BMB-101 will fully engage 5-HT2C receptors, and therefore not be dose-limited by side effects, which will help to achieve maximal efficacy in future Phase 2 studies. Dose limited side effects exhibited by first generation 5-HT2C agonists have prevented exploiting the full potential of this pharmacological mechanism.Story continues“We are highly encouraged by the Phase 1 study observations and results, which give us confidence in selecting doses of BMB-101 for testing in refractory epilepsies and other disorders where serotonin 2C agonists are indicated. Learnings from the study will inform our path forward as we seek to develop effective therapeutic options with convenient dosing regimens for patients,” stated Mark A. Smith, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer of Bright Minds.“There is a great opportunity and an unmet need to develop improved treatments for these and potentially numerous other indications, including psychosis and addiction disorders. The successful and on-time completion of the study is an important achievement for us, as we continue to evolve from a drug discovery to a drug development stage company. BMB-101 is now a Phase 2 ready asset, and we look forward to sharing our further progress,” stated Ian McDonald, CEO of Bright Minds.The Company is currently awaiting the qEEG (Quantitative Electroencephalogram) data and will provide a more detailed discussion of the Phase 1 results when available.About the Phase 1 StudyPart 1 – Single Ascending Dose4 cohorts (6 drug and 2 placebo) – single dose (oral solution)Reached the planned top dose of 180 mg/70 kg, which approached preclinical exposure limitsWell tolerated with predictable PKMost common adverse event was oral paresthesias from liquid formulationPart 2 – Food Effect12 subjects – crossover with and without breakfast, 120 mg/70kgEffect of food on BMB-101 levels was relatively small, and therefore BMB-101 can be administered without the need for fastingPart 3 – Multiple Ascending Dose4 cohorts (6 drug and 2 placebo) – twice a day dosing for seven days after mealsReached a top dose of 150 mg/70 kg twice a dayBiomarkers for central target engagement: Prolactin release and qEEGGood Manufacturing Practices (GMP) production completed for BMB-101 drug substance and drug product.About BMB-101BMB-101, a highly selective 5-HT2C, Gq-protein biased agonist, has demonstrated compelling activity in a host of in vitro and in vivo nonclinical tests. Compared to Lorcaserin, BMB-101 exhibits strong Gq biased signaling, coupled with minimal beta-arrestin recruitment. Bright Minds believes that G-protein biased signaling translates to better tolerance profile for this second-generation 5-HT2C agonist, making BMB-101 a best-in-class 5-HT2C agonist. Mechanistically, Serotonin (5-Hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) is a monoamine neurotransmitter widely expressed in the central nervous system, and drugs modulating 5-HT have made a major impact in mental health disorders. Central 5-HT systems have long been associated with the control of ingestive behaviors and the modulation of the behavioral effects of psychostimulants, opioids, alcohol, and nicotine. Results of clinical trials and animal studies indicate that 5-HT2C receptor agonists may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of addiction by decreasing the intake of opioids as well as impulsive behavior that can escalate compulsive drug use. BMB-101 is a new chemical entity (NCE) and constitutes as a novel scaffold 5-HT2C agonist.5-HT2C agonism is a well proven anticonvulsant mechanism. In translational animal models, BMB-101 demonstrated a significant reduction in both the number and intensity of epileptic seizures and is a promising candidate for the treatment of Dravet Syndrome and other epilepsies. The Phase 1 trial (NCT 05397041) has been completed and BMB-101 is now Phase 2 ready.About Bright MindsBright Minds is focused on developing novel transformative treatments for neuropsychiatric disorders, epilepsy, and pain. Bright Minds has a portfolio of next-generation serotonin agonists designed to target neurocircuit abnormalities that are responsible for difficult to treat disorders such as resistant epilepsy, treatment resistant depression, PTSD, and pain. The Company leverages its world-class scientific and drug development expertise to bring forward the next generation of safe and efficacious drugs. Bright Minds’ drugs have been designed to potentially retain the powerful therapeutic aspects of psychedelic and other serotonergic compounds, while minimizing the side effects, thereby creating superior drugs to first-generation compounds, such as psilocybin.Investor Contacts:Lisa WilsonE: lwilson@insitecony.comT: 917-543-9932Ian McDonaldCEO and DirectorE: ian@brightmindsbio.comT: 917-543-9932This news release includes certain statements that may be deemed “forward-looking statements.” All statements in this new release, other than statements of historical facts, that address events or developments that the Company expects to occur, are forward-looking statements.

2023-07-23,"Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript July 20, 2023Operator: Good morning. My name is Todd, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Second Quarter 2023 Discover Financial Services Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there'll be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Eric Wasserstrom, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Eric Wasserstrom: Thanks, Todd. And good morning, everyone. Welcome to this morning's call. I'll begin on Slide 2 of our earnings presentation, which you can find in financial section of our Investor Relations website investorrelations.discover.com. Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements that appear in our second quarter earnings release and presentation. On our call today, we'll include remarks from our CEO, Roger Hochschild and, John Green, our Chief Financial Officer. After we conclude our formal comments, there will be time for a Q&A session. During the Q&A session, we ask that you pose one question followed by one follow-up question. After your follow-up question, please return to the queue. Now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Roger.Roger Hochschild: Thank you, Eric, and thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. I'll begin by reviewing some of our highlights for the quarter and then discuss the regulatory matter that we've disclosed in our press release. John will then take you through the details of our second quarter results and our updated perspectives on 2023. Last night, we reported second quarter net income of $901 million or $3.54 per share. The quarter was characterized by strong asset and deposit growth, while credit is performing right in line with our expectations. Importantly, we advanced several operational priorities this quarter. One key milestone occurred in May when we relaunched our cash back debit product. We're excited by the positive early results we're seeing so far.Story continuesCard, Client, BankPhoto by Dylan Gillis on UnsplashIn the first few weeks, we opened over 30,000 new accounts and plan to begin national marketing in support of this product in the fall. The relaunch advances our goal of becoming the leading direct bank and over time we expect cash back debit will be a significant entry point into the Discover franchise. We also continue to expand the Discover Global Network. This quarter, we announced five new partnerships in the Asia Pacific region and added a new partnership with Guavapay in the UK. These strategic partnerships underscore our commitment to building out our international acceptance. And lastly, we continue to invest in our human capital. We're honored to have been recognized as the 2023 Best Places to Work for People with Disabilities. This builds upon our recent recognitions as one of Fortune's 100 Best Companies to Work For, Best Workplaces for Parents, and Best Workplaces for Women.As you may have read in our press release last night, beginning around mid-2007, we incorrectly classified certain card accounts into our highest merchant and merchant acquirer pricing tier. We are taking actions correct this card product misclassification going forward and are preparing a program to compensate affected merchants and acquirers. While the financial impacts of this misclassification are not material, it underscored deficiencies in our corporate governance and risk management. We're in discussions with our regulators regarding these matters. We have received a proposed consent order from the FDIC in connection with consumer compliance, which does not cover the misclassification topic. We believe additional supervisory actions could occur.I want to emphasize that we take our business practices and compliance very seriously. We've made significant progress and investment in this area and look forward to working with our Board and our regulators to achieve further advancement. Now I'll hand it over to John to review our results and updated outlook in more detail.John Greene: Thank you, Roger, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to open by addressing the financial implications of the card misclassification. We have established a liability on our balance sheet of $365 million to accrue for estimated compensation owed to merchant and acquirers. In establishing the liability, we adjusted retained earnings by $255 million net of tax. $11 million was taken this quarter and is reflected in discount and interchange revenue. The first half 2023 impact was $22 million. With that, I'll transition to our financial summary results on Slide 4. From this, you can see that the financial performance of the business remains solid. In the quarter, we reported net income of $901 million, which was 18% lower year-over-year.Our results reflect strong revenue growth partially offset by a provision increase driven by receivable growth and higher expenses. The trends for the quarter were robust loan growth, a low efficiency ratio even as we invested in compliance management and technology, and strong capital and liquidity positions. Further details are reflected on Slide 5. Net interest income was up $567 million year-over-year or 22%. Our net interest margin ended the quarter at 11.06%, up 12 basis points from the prior year and down 28 basis points sequentially. The benefits from higher prime rates were offset by higher funding costs and increased promotional balances. Receivable growth was robust. Card increased 19% year-over-year, reflecting a lower payment rate versus the prior year and modest sales growth.The card payment rate remains stable quarter-over-quarter and about 200 basis points over 2019 levels. Sales volume grew 3% in the quarter. Through mid-July, growth continued to slow and was up about 1%. Turning to our non-card products. Personal loans were up 27% driven by strength in originations over the past year. We continue to experience strong consumer demand while staying disciplined in our underwriting. Deposit growth in the quarter was solid, with average consumer deposits up 20% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Our direct-to-consumer balances grew $2 billion and consumer deposits made up 66% of our total funding mix. We continue to target 70-plus-percent of funding from deposits. Looking at other revenue on Slide 6. Non-interest income increased $98 million or 16%.This was partially due to a $42 million loss on our equity investments in the prior year quarter compared to a $1 million gain this quarter. Adjusting for these, our non-interest income was up 9%, primarily driven by loan fee income. Moving to expenses on Slide 7. Total operating expenses were up $181 million or 15% year-over-year and up 2% from the prior quarter, primarily driven by our investments in our compliance management systems. These investments impacted several of our expense line items. Looking at our major expense categories, compensation costs were up $73 million or 14%, primarily due to increased headcount. Marketing expense increased $14 million or 6% as we prudently invested for growth, particularly in our deposits and personal loan products.Our commitment to disciplined cost management has not changed and we continue to target an efficiency ratio in the high 30s. Moving to credit performance on Slide 8. Total net charge-offs were 3.22%, 142 basis points higher than the prior year and up 50 basis points from the prior quarter. Consistent with our expectation, we are seeing credit normalization across all of our lending products. Looking ahead in card, we continue to expect the seasoning of new accounts vintages and normalization of older vintages to result in higher losses through the back half of this year and into 2024. Turning to the allowance for credit losses on Slide 9. This quarter, we increased our reserve by $373 million, driven by our double-digit loan growth. Our reserve rate remained flat at 6.8%.Our outlook on the macro economy has improved modestly. We continue to monitor economic conditions and will make adjustments to our expectations as needed. Looking at slide 10, our capital position remains robust. Our common equity Tier 1 for the period was 11.7%, well ahead of regulatory requirements. The cumulative impact of the correction to the financial statements related to the card misclassification reduced our CET1 ratio by approximately 20 basis points. In the quarter, we repurchased 6.8 million shares of common stock and declared a quarterly common dividend of $0.70 per share. As Roger indicated, we are reviewing our compliance, risk management and corporate governance and are in discussions with our regulators on these topics. While this is ongoing, we have decided to pause share repurchases.Concluding on Slide 11 with our outlook. There has been no change to our loan growth expectations to be in the low to mid-teens. We are updating our NIM expectations to be around 11% for the full year, reflecting a combination of slightly lower asset yields driven by promotional mix and higher funding costs. We are raising our guidance for operating expenses to be up low double digits. As previously indicated, we are seeing upward pressure on expenses from the build-out of our compliance management systems. And we are lowering our expected range of net charge-offs to 3.4% to 3.6% based on our current delinquencies and roll rates. To wrap up, our business model continues to generate solid financial results and our capital, funding and liquidity positions remain strong.We continue to invest in actions that drive sustainable long-term performance, enable us to achieve excellence in all parts of our business.

ParrellThank you, Marty. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today to discuss our second quarter 2023 results. As we work our way through the leasing season, the business is performing well, with same-store expenses now looking a little bit better than we thought, leading us to lower our guidance for that item last night. As a result of this and lower expected interest expense, we are pleased to again raise our same-store net operating income and normalized funds from operations guidance after raising same-store NOI and NFFO guidance, just 2 months ago based on better expected revenue results. In a moment, Michael Manelis will give you color on revenue drivers across our markets. After Michael's remarks, Bob will address the details of the improvement in our expense and NFFO guidance, as well as our successful pending refinancing activity. The overall theme here is that Equity Residential continues to benefit, like most of the multifamily industry from solid demand, but with the more unique benefit of our mostly coastal portfolio being less exposed to the significant levels of supply just beginning to be delivered in the Sunbelt markets. We also continue to manage expenses well in an inflationary environment, which we expect will allow us to drive more dollars to the bottom line than our competitors over time. In terms of specifics, in the quarter we continued to post strong same-store revenue results driven by good demand across our markets and rapidly improving delinquency in Southern California. As you may recall, we increased the midpoint of our same-store revenue guidance for the year to 5.875% in May, right before the NAREIT conference to reflect these factors. That, in turn, caused an improvement of 100 basis points in our same-store NOI guidance midpoint and a $0.03 per share improvement in NFFO guidance at the midpoint. These continued strong operating results speak to the durable nature of our business in the face of some pretty volatile economic conditions. Despite the layoff headlines, particularly in the tech sector that dominated the news in late 2022 and early 2023, we see substantial demand from our affluent renter demographic. Also in places like Seattle, we are hopeful that the return to office mandates by employers like Amazon will drive incremental demand back into the urban areas of the city as commute times become intolerable for workers who dispersed far outside the city in response to COVID and are now required to be in the office frequently and as quality of life issues in these urban areas improve. And while new supply is certainly pressuring the Sunbelt and Denver markets, as I mentioned before, we are seeing moderate levels of supply in most of our major markets. Even in Washington, D.C., where we are seeing the highest levels of competitive new supply is being absorbed at a good rate, and the market is performing well. Switching over to the transactions market. That market continues to be relatively quiet. We did not sell anything in the second quarter. But we did buy a couple of deals, including a newly developed property in lease-up in Atlanta, that I spoke about on our first quarter call. The other acquisition in the second quarter is a 287-unit property located in suburban Denver, which we purchased for approximately $108 million at an acquisition cap rate of 5%. The transaction market generally remains stuck between buyers who expect lower prices given the huge shift in interest rates and a less accommodative capital markets and sellers who remain wedded to early 2022 values and by and large, have assets that are still operating pretty well, so they feel no great compulsion to sell right now. Our sense is that sales will pick up over the next 6 to 12 months as sellers accept the reality of rates being higher for longer as floating rate loans with expiring caps reset, and as developer capital invested in newly completed development deals becomes impatient. Now a quick note on our capital allocation strategy. As we have discussed with you for the past few years, we continue to have a goal of having a more balanced portfolio between urban and suburban and between coastal and Sunbelt markets. We think such a portfolio will create the highest returns and lowest volatility over time. The recent issues caused by COVID in urban centers and the current issues in the Sunbelt markets due to supply are examples of the opportunities and risks we wish to balance. As opportunities present themselves in the Sunbelt and Denver markets and in select suburban locations of our coastal markets to acquire or develop great assets at fair prices, we will be there to do so. And before I turn it over to Michael, I want to take a moment to celebrate our 30 years as a public company. On August 12, 1993, Equity Residential went public on the New York Stock Exchange. Much has happened in the past 30 years. We grew from about 21,000 units, an initial valuation of $800 million in 1993 to more than 225,000 units across more than 50 markets at the peak, leading to our 80,000 units and a value of more than $26 billion today. On this journey, we acquired a number of other public apartment REITs as well as some very large private portfolios, including Archstone. At the head of this enterprise for all those years was our amazing founder and Chairman, Sam Zell, who we lost in May. Sam's guidance and influence are part of our DNA at Equity Residential, and we will continue to run this company to honor his legacy of delivering superior, long-term value to our shareholders. We thank all of you for your support over the past 30 years and for your kind words regarding Sam's passing. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Michael.Michael L. ManelisThanks, Mark, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. This morning, I will review the second quarter 2023 operating performance in our markets. We continue to produce very solid results with same-store revenue growth of 5.5% in the second quarter that are in line with our improved May guidance expectations. Results are driven by a continuing improvement in delinquency along with a continued healthy fundamentals in the business. As with last quarter, East Coast markets continue to outperform West Coast. Our results to date reflect our view that we have previously shared with you that pricing trends will follow a normal, albeit slightly muted seasonal trajectory. Generally, layoff announcements seem to have dissipated and our average resident remains in great financial shape with rent-to-income ratios during the quarter for new residents continuing to hover around 20%. Resident lease breaks and transfer activities to reduce rent, often early indicators of resident economic stress remain below pre-pandemic levels and in line with seasonal expectations. The overall employment picture continues to be healthy. and young adults are choosing the attractive lifestyles available in our markets. Single-family home purchases continue to be an expensive proposition. In fact, less than 8% of our residents gave buy home as the reason for their move out in the second quarter, which is well below the 12% norm for this period. Combine this with the overall favorable competitive new supply position we face in most of our markets, and we are on track for a good year in 2023. As a reminder, a combination of more difficult same-store revenue comparison periods, including the absence of governmental rental relief this year and a reversion to a more normal rent growth pattern will result in more moderate, but still above historical growth in the second half of 2023. As we sit here today in the back half of our primary leasing season, the portfolio is 96% occupied with good demand and resident retention. We expect a continued healthy trajectory for the remainder of the leasing season. Our portfolio-wide occupancy is being depressed by turnover in Southern California, primarily L.A. as we work our way through the delinquency issues. In the longer run, replacing these vacant units with paying residents outweighs the slightly lower short-term occupancy. Now let me spend a few minutes talking about market performance. So let's start with the East Coast. New York was by far the top performer for the second quarter with same-store residential revenue growth of more than 13%. We have very little competitive new supply in the market, and our occupancy sits near 97%. Demand indicators continue to be positive, making this market the expected top performer for the year. Boston produced slightly above 8% same-store revenue growth in the second quarter driven by strong demand across the submarkets with our urban properties outperforming our suburban ones. We continue to hear stories of tough commute times for suburbanites, that are resulting in residents coming back to the city. While new supply in the market is above the 5-year average, the large majority of it is not competitive with our assets and appears to be readily absorbed. Heading down to D.C. This market continues to impress with same-store revenue growth of 6.3% in the second quarter despite a high level of new supply across a number of submarkets. The market just keeps going, absorbing these units at a healthy pace and delivering some of the best revenue growth in the portfolio. As an example, Reverb, our new 312-unit development in Central D.C. which is currently in lease-up is delivering weekly application volumes well above expectations, allowing us to reduce concessions and push rate. Occupancy in the D.C. market is just below 97% and we are optimistic for continued strong performance for the year, but recognize the increased volume of new supply that will be delivered in the rest of this year. Now for the West Coast. Our Southern California markets achieved some of the strongest sequential revenue growth in the quarter, demonstrating the early financial benefits of backfilling long-term delinquent units with paying residents. Unlike the Orange County and San Diego markets, which posted good quarter-over-quarter revenue growth, Los Angeles produced slightly negative quarter-over-quarter revenue growth. This reported number, however, is not indicative of the health of the market but more noise from bad debt due to large rental relief receipts in the second quarter of 2022. When you strip this noise out, same-store quarter-over-quarter revenue growth would have been over 5% positive for L.A. We are still seeing healthy demand in Los Angeles and have not felt any negative impact from the workers' strikes in the entertainment industry. Our direct exposure is not significant but acknowledge it may soften overall market conditions in the coming months, which could slow our ability to release some of our vacant units. In addition to the strike, we continue to see more nonpaying residents move out which is resulting in at least 100 basis point drag to occupancy in the market. We view both of these issues as isolated short-term impacts to the market as the strikes will end and delinquency will gradually resolve itself which, coupled with the long-term demand, we see as catalyst for next year above average market growth in L.A. Moving to San Francisco. The market reported respectable quarter-over-quarter revenue growth of 3.1%, which would have been 4.6% after adjusting for the impact of rental relief receipts in the second quarter of 2022. Overall, the San Francisco market demonstrated leasing velocity in line with normal seasonal trends and met our expectations for the second quarter. The South Bay, which represents 37% of our NOI in the market, continues to be a bright spot. Prospects are telling our local teams that the area meets their hybrid work requirements by keeping them close for in-office days and providing better lifestyle options and more space and access to the natural outdoor amenities. Our recent resident survey tells us that 77% of our residents in the San Francisco Bay Area are either hybrid or fully in office. In downtown San Francisco, we hear from our teams that new residents say that they are leasing to get closer to work. The good news is that the quality of life in downtown San Francisco continues to improve and the local government's focus seems to be showing some signs of promise. While our pricing power in the submarket remains less than desired, and concessions are still being used, downtown has been stable and allowed us to capture demand and regain occupancy to 96% in that submarket. The overall sentiment in the San Francisco market indicates that the tech layoffs are mostly behind us, and there's a lot of momentum around the AI, which keeps us optimistic on the continued recovery in this market. Heading to Seattle, while there is vibrancy in the market with improvements in the quality of life issues, some return to office activity and tourism back to pre-pandemic levels, the market continues to underperform our expectations. While net effective pricing in the overall market is now 2% below the March 2020 levels, there's a wide dispersion among submarkets with the downtown Seattle well below the March 2020 levels primarily due to the continued concession use in the submarket. Overall, Seattle has been a market that has struggled to deliver consistent strong demand over the last couple of years as its tech-heavy workforce has had the flexibility to work from anywhere. For this market to fully recover, it needs to see more consistent strong job growth with better quality of life conditions that will bring people back to the market. The good news is that we are starting to see some positive signs in South Lake Union, which is a tech-heavy neighborhood in the city of Seattle, and this is likely due to the Amazon return to office, which began in May. We are hopeful that this activity will soon spill over to the other downtown submarkets. Finally, in our expansion markets, which currently make up about 5% of our same-store NOI, revenue performance has been mostly in line with our acquisition pro formas and guidance expectations. Our portfolios in Denver, Dallas and Austin continue to be the most impacted by new supply like we discussed last quarter. Meanwhile, Atlanta remains a bright spot with double-digit revenue growth for both the quarter and year-to-date. In a minute, I will turn it over to Bob to discuss our operating expense performance and the balance sheet. But let me take a minute to discuss our operating platform, which is humming as we continue to reap the benefits of our focus on innovation and the technology evolution of Equity. We are focused on the customer experience and the feedback we receive from our customers help us in developing our platform to drive superior financial performance and customer satisfaction. The insights we gained from our resident survey, which garnered more than 32,000 responses validates our strategy of combining our growing data science capabilities with streamlined execution while delivering self-service solutions to our customers. Leveraging data and analytics on top of our resident feedback will create further opportunities to expand our operating margin. With a fully centralized and mobile operating platform, we are in a strong position to create a seamless customer experience with a platform that continues to allow us to innovate, experiment and rapidly scale what works across this portfolio. I want to give a shout out for our amazing teams across our platform for their continued dedication to their residents and focus on delivering these terrific operating results. With that, I will turn the call over to Bob.Robert A. GarechanaThanks, Michael. Let me start with expenses before covering our financing activities. We reported same-store expense growth of 5.5% in the quarter. The main drivers of this growth were repairs and maintenance and on-site payroll. Repairs and maintenance growth in the quarter was driven by continued wage pressure, particularly from contracted services. Payroll growth was mostly due to elevated employee benefit costs during the quarter relative to the same period last year. Without these costs, reported payroll growth would have been 2.6%, which was more in line with our expectations and reflective of the efficiencies we have been achieving from our various operating initiatives. For the full year, same-store expense guidance, we have lowered the midpoint of our range by 25 basis points to 4.25%. This reduction is driven by expectations of continued low real estate tax growth due to modest rate increases and successful appeals activity as well as significantly lower expectations for commodity prices, which are muting utilities expense growth. These more favorable trends will be partially offset by slightly higher payroll and other on-site expenses stemming from the elevated employee benefit costs mentioned from Q2 and administrative costs from the expiration of the eviction moratoriums, respectively. The revised guidance implies a significantly lower rate of growth for expenses during the second half of the year relative to our results through Q2. We think that this is challenging, but definitely achievable given the easier comparable period from the back half of 2022 and the visibility we have into the items I just described. Finally, turning to the capital markets and our 2023 refinancing activities. As we previously discussed, the company has an $800 million secured debt pool that matures in the middle of the fourth quarter. The debt originated from the Archstone transaction back in 2013, currently carries a rate of 4.21% and a portion of it needs to be refinanced in the secured market for tax reasons. During Q2, we began marketing this opportunity to lenders, and I'm happy to report we received significant interest from a variety of capital providers. In July, we selected lenders and entered into 2 loan commitments and locked in slightly below 5.25% rate for the $530 million that we're refinancing. This was approximately 135 basis points over the 10-year treasury at the time and was lower than what we would have expected to do had we been issuing an unsecured bond. As you may recall, we previously also entered into interest rate swaps to hedge this financing, and those were settled for an over $25 million gain. When the gain is amortized over the life of the loan, it results in an economic cost for these financings of 4.7%, which we believe is an excellent outcome, given the environment. Once these loans close, we would expect the company to end the year with approximately 8% floating rate debt, over $2 billion in immediately available liquidity and no real debt maturities outside of commercial paper until June of 2025. This, coupled with the lowest leverage in the company's history position us very well should any opportunities arise. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for question and answers.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) We'll go first to Eric Wolfe with Citi.Eric WolfeLooking at your guidance, there's a nice ramp in your earnings in the back half of the year. Just curious if there's anything sort of more onetime or seasonal or nonrecurring on the expense side there? And if I were to sort of just take that at run rate, is that sort of a good run rate to think about going into 2024? Or again, is there something that's sort of elevating it?Robert A. GarechanaEric, it's Bob. So looking at kind of our NFFO for Q3 and Q4, it's -- there's nothing really, in particular, that's a standout on a onetime item. It's really the cumulative growth in NOI that you're seeing in Q3 and then pushing that into Q4 coming from same store. Drilling down a little bit into that, I would say the only thing from a sequential standpoint that is maybe a little bit abnormal is the bad debt component. So we're seeing bad debt improve in the fourth quarter -- and in the third quarter sequentially as we get back to a normalization. So beyond that, there isn't really anything sequentially strange about the -- or onetime in nature about the growth or run rate. As it relates to '24, I think it's a little early to talk about kind of '24, kind of where we are in terms of positioning. But what I would tell you is our numbers are kind of following that typical seasonal pattern that we would have seen and same-store is really driving the operational results.Eric WolfeUnderstood. That's helpful. And then you mentioned L.A. and the writer strike, the actor strike. It doesn't sound like it's really impacting bad debt or rent growth yet, but you said it could impact in a couple of months. Just curious what that's sort of based on and that's already factored into your guidance as well.Michael L. ManelisEric, this is Michael. So I think right now, of course, we're watching to see, is anybody turning keys in, breaking leases, at a pace that's kind of above what you would expect to see. And we really just haven't seen any impact from the strikes and our on-site folks are telling us just the overall direct exposure to it doesn't seem to be significant. I think my comments in the prepared remarks were -- right now, we clearly are running occupancy about 100 basis points below normal for this time of year in that L.A. market. So the ability to lease up some of these units that have been vacant, which were from the delinquent, long-term delinquent residents moving out earlier in the year than what we thought. We just think that if the strike is prolonged and keeps going on, it could just create a little bit of a pause in people's willingness to make decisions, to move into a new place, and that could impact just the overall demand profile in the market. But to date, we're really not seeing anything, and I'm not overly concerned about it. But it is something we just got to be aware of.OperatorWe'll go next to John Pawlowski with Green Street.John Joseph PawlowskiMy first question is on the transaction market. Alex, just curious what range of pricing do you think you could achieve on kind of large urban assets in the central business districts of San Fran and Seattle today, just given the sentiment in these markets is still pretty -- well, maybe it's proven, still pretty down. So just curious what type of bid for those types of assets is today.Alexander BrackenridgeJohn, it's Alex. Yes, there would not be a robust bid today. Larger properties are harder to sell. There's some contrary and money out there, but I don't know if it's willing to make a big bet. So I really don't have an exact number because I just haven't seen a trade. I think most people, if they didn't have to trade, just wouldn't be willing to accept the number. So it's almost theoretical at this point. I think over time, that will change as the markets continue to improve and access to capital becomes more normal. It's just such an abnormally hard time to raise sizable capital that I really think it would be a tough time. It would be -- if it was a distressed sale, it would be a pretty high cap rate and maybe not indicative of what the more -- less distressed owner would be willing to sell at.Mark J. ParrellAnd John, it's Mark. Just to add to that. I mean when you think about what supports apartment values, there's certainly a lot of unallocated private capital. I mean, we've heard numbers up to $800 billion of private capital looking worldwide for real estate exposure. So I think people, chief investment officers, those kind of funds just need to see some stability before they're willing to move. I'm hopeful that towards the end of this year and early next, we'll be talking to you about some better numbers in those markets operationally. And I think that will also encourage capital flows. But I agree with Alex. I think it'd be really hard to peg a cap rate. It's almost like on a per unit per square foot basis kind of conversation at the moment. But I think that's going to shift given the amount of capital on the sidelines. And given our hope that operating results will improve over the next 12 months.John Joseph PawlowskiOkay. That makes sense. I guess, over the coming months or quarters when there is a little bit more price discovery, do you expect cap rates for these types of larger gateway trophy assets to be meaningfully higher than more suburban assets in this kind of post-COVID environment?Alexander BrackenridgeWell, what you run into is what ends up being a really compelling discount to replacement cost. So I think people will start looking at that and realize that getting in at a good basis in one of these good cities is just really compelling. So I just really think that will be a floor and we'll prevent too much of a gap from arising.John Joseph PawlowskiOkay. Final question, Mark. Just longer term, as you see these cities heal from COVID, what -- and not meant to be precise, but rough order of magnitude, what's the right urban versus suburban mix in the EQR portfolio 5 years from now while we're on this call?Mark J. ParrellGreat question. We've sort of thought about, as we see ourselves as sort of 60% or so urban right now. And to get that number below 50% would probably be a goal. I think expanding into the Sunbelt markets, as you know, is a goal, and I think a great opportunity with the amount of product that's coming through. And I think in the suburban markets in some of our current coastal areas is a good idea too. So my guess, John, is you'll see sort of 1/3 of the portfolio in Denver and the Sunbelt markets 5 years from now. And you'll sort of see more of a 50-50 split urban, suburban. But we are a creature of opportunity. And if there was an opportunity to be -- to stay more urban because it was just absolutely compelling prices, as Alex described, John, we'd certainly think hard about that. I mean we're not -- we feel like having a more balanced platform will give us better cash flow growth, more stable cash flow growth over time. But the name of the game is buying right. And if we can buy very well, we might move tactically for a while a different direction.OperatorWe'll go next to Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.Stephen Thomas SakwaI was wondering if you could maybe just talk about where you're sending out renewal notices. I know you've provided some July data. But like what is August and September look like? And I guess, where do those discussions look like? And I guess, where are you seeing the most pressure on the new leases?Michael L. ManelisSteve, this is Michael. So for the renewals right now, you're right. We've got -- our quotes are out there for the next 3 months or so. It's been fairly consistent as what we've seen in the last couple of months. And right now, based on conversations we've been seeing through our centralized renewal team, we don't really expect to see a lot of variation. We think we're going to continue to renew about 55% to 60% of our residents and achieve right around a 5% to 5.5% kind of achieved renewal rate growth, which incorporates a little bit more negotiation. And typically, what you see is as you get into the beginning of the peak leasing season, our centralized renewal teams, we tightened up that negotiation range, call it to like 100, 150 basis points up-quote. Now what we expect to see as we get in towards the tail end of the peak leasing season just to kind of drop that off a little bit and probably negotiate about 200 basis points off of the quotes that are out there. But again, I think we remain really optimistic about the performance. Centralizing this team has really given us the ability to kind of pivot quickly and really deliver consistent results. In terms of the new lease pressure right now, I think if you would just look at some of the reported stats and you could see kind of in Seattle and San Francisco, where you're still doing that concessions in those urban centers, that's definitely weighing in on some of our ability to have a new lease change kind of go positive. But again, I think overall, where we sit today in this leasing season, it's playing out kind of exactly like we thought, where rents are sitting, where our new lease changes and the renewal performance and we just see kind of the markets reacting like they normally will through kind of the season, and that's kind of what's baked into the guidance that we have.Stephen Thomas SakwaGreat. And then I guess just on the development front. I know you've got a handful of projects, I think one wholly owned and several joint venture developments. Can you just remind us kind of where those development yields are likely to pencil out and I guess, Mark, how are you thinking about the prospect of any future development? If we're hearing correctly, merchant builders are starting to scale back their development teams and hopefully, over the next 18 months, that development pipeline starts to shrink. But I guess how are you thinking about the future pipeline for EQR?Mark J. ParrellSteve, it's Mark, and Alex may join in a second. I mean we've got -- it's good to have a solid internal team, which we have and good JV relationships with [Toll] and others. And we see all this stuff. But as Alex has said on prior calls, it's just not penciling out. There's not enough of a risk premium in what is a risky endeavor of development. So for us, I think acquisitions seem like a better place to invest capital for the time being. I think what could change there is just some sense that either rents have moved a lot. I doubt costs are going to move down in any material regard. But I think right now, I like the development pipeline being smaller. In terms of the yields we're looking at, it's mid- to high 5s on our existing portfolio. The Laguna Clara deal in California, which is a one mile away from Apple's headquarters deal is a little lower than that. It's an existing asset we're densifying. So there's less risk since we know the area so well. But beyond that, Steve, they're kind of high-5 type of situations and to do a development deal, we need something to get into that close to that 6 range. And I don't know, we may start a deal this year. We may not start anything. We'll see.OperatorWe'll go next to Josh Dennerlein with Bank of America.Joshua DennerleinMichael, in your opening remarks, you mentioned operating platform initiatives and I think you mentioned some margin expansion potential there. Any early thoughts on where the margins can ultimately go? And maybe over what kind of time frame you're thinking?Michael L. ManelisJosh, this is Michael. So maybe I'll just hit on overall kind of some of the initiatives and the innovations, and I'll let Bob kind of touch base on the actual margins. So I think what we put out in our May investor presentation, really just kind of highlighted the initiatives that we have keyed up. And this year, specific to 2023, we have about $10 million included in the NOI guidance with about 2/3 of that being on the expense front as we keep working through kind of the innovations of leveraging resources across assets. And right now, we're really focused on kind of teeing up the next round of initiatives and it's really more income-based and probably other income-based items that will really kick into gear in the back half of this year and start delivering kind of results into 2024. Right now, we are literally right on track with our numbers, and we feel really confident about the incremental $10 million for '23 and maybe, Bob, if you just want to hit on the overall margin impact of that.Robert A. GarechanaYes. So from a margin standpoint, that will all be accretive to margin. I guess I would say that in the space, we talk -- we all talk about very different margins. So I'm going to talk about the margin, I guess, that I think is most important, which is the cash flow margin, which we highlighted at the NAREIT conference. So cash flow margin, meaning after CapEx, after expense and all of that. We're already running at a league-leading level as it relates to that cash flow margin. And when you layer in the initiatives that Michael is talking about, and that's inclusive of what you have to spend in order to achieve that ROI in CapEx, et cetera, we think we can get a few percentage points of incremental increase there, and that's what we're striving for.Joshua DennerleinOkay. Appreciate that. And then at the opening remarks on Seattle, it just seems like it's the only legacy market you're facing with supply concerns. How long will it take to kind of work through that supply?Michael L. ManelisYes. So Josh, this is Michael again. So right now in Seattle, we're kind of actually in a low of going up against kind of head-to-head competitive supply. If you look at what's expected to be delivered and completed in '24, I think we're going to see that Seattle number kind of in jump on us, and it is something we're absolutely kind of watching and kind of making sure that those units will be delivered. And when we create our guidance for '24, it's something that we will fold into that market. For us, right now, Seattle, it's just been -- it kind of gets momentum and then it stalls a little bit and then it gets momentum. So we really just haven't felt that consistent kind of strong job growth that's really needed to get us back on track and really get us out of that concessionary environment. But to date, it's not really the new supply that's been impacting us.Mark J. ParrellYes, I just want to make a comment on Seattle. It's obviously, for most of us pretty far away. So people aren't out there quite as much. But there's been an amazing renaissance in the city in terms of access to the waterfront, very similar to the big dig in Boston. I think that's a very positive catalyst for quality of life in the downtown area where we have a lot of assets. I do think there's an election coming up. There's been an improvement in attitude in city government about livability and those issues. That's a positive. But I think Michael is right. I think you're going to see a lot of supply, which, on the one hand, Seattle is a market where actually, the percent of rent to income is lowest with New York for us. So there's an ability to pay more rent and there's a lot of high-paying jobs and a lot of good industry in the Seattle metro area. And as the city gets, we hope more livable as people take advantage of these new waterfront amenities. And I think we feel good about Seattle and its ability to draw people in, again, in scale. And Amazon has just kind of called people back to the office. Our folks on the ground say there is some momentum there in South Lake Union, where Amazon has a lot of office workers. So we'll see where that takes us as well. But you asked a very narrow question. I'm giving you more, but I do have a sense of optimism about Seattle, but we have to navigate some of that supply the next, really in '24 and '25 more than in '23.OperatorWe'll go next to John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.John P. KimYou described the strong backdrop in your markets and potentially some demand catalysts going forward. But if we just wanted to isolate July, it looks like the blended lease growth rates had decelerated versus June. And I'm wondering if you -- has that surprised you at all or potentially -- it seems like it would have peaked now rather than peaking a month ago.Michael L. ManelisYes. John, this is Michael. So I'm going to touch on a few different things here. Let me -- I'm going to start just kind of the rents first, and then I'll address the new lease change relative to July. And I'll tell you just -- we went back and we've looked at like the last 15 years of our data and our pricing trend which is that net effective price for our units. It typically peaks out somewhere in that late August to -- or late July to mid-August period. And really the first week of August is kind of that most common time frame. I'll tell you, we've had really strong foot traffic, strong application volume. So I'm not going to be surprised that if we don't see a few more weeks of slight increases in rates kind of coming through our system. And that being said, I mean, right now, this pricing trend is up about 6% since the beginning of the year, and it's right where we thought it was going to be. So even if we just peaked out at this level right now, it's kind of right in line and we'll be just buying in terms of it flowing through the other stats. In terms of that deceleration of new lease change, I'd start by saying I would not read too much into any single month. As this stat, it's really better to look at over time. And I think the -- what you saw in our release, it was like a 10 basis point difference. That's just a lot of noise from maybe who moved out versus who moved in and where that was being done. And right now, I'll say that the new lease change is being more impacted by that concession use in the urban centers of Seattle and San Francisco. But again, I think as we turn the corner and we start looking at August, I wouldn't be surprised if those [numbers] inch back up a little bit. We're really in this tight band relative to our expectations of both new lease renewals and how that kind of translates into that blended new lease or the blended rate. So I wouldn't read too much into any 1 month stat.John P. KimOkay. On the secured debt that you raised at [4.7], it looks like your unsecured notes with a similar term trades around 50 basis points above that. How does that spread you secured versus unsecured, how is that 50 basis points compared to historical? And if this continues would the secured market look more attractive to you going forward?Robert A. GarechanaYes. So let me break down -- John, it's Bob. Let me break down a couple of pieces. When you're comparing the [4.70] to what I'm guessing you're comparing to where our unsecured are trading today, what you're incorporating in that is the impact of the hedges, right? So in my prepared remarks, I mentioned that when we issue the secure -- we haven't issued it, but when we locked rate on the secured loan, we were at 135 basis points on the treasury at that time, which was, call it 5.25. How you get to 4.70 as you apply the gain that we got because we did some forward starting swaps at really attractive rates, and that reduced it to 4.70 . So what we should compare is really the spread, that 135 basis points that I talked about in my prepared remarks, to where the spread that would be implied at our unsecured and that's a lot more narrow. That's probably 5 to 10 basis points hit or miss between either one. So they're relatively on top of each other. We think maybe we're maybe 5 basis points inside on secured, but that's 1 day's worth of trading activity could flip you and you could be at parity.OperatorWe'll go next to Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo.James Colin FeldmanI was hoping you can dig a little deeper into D.C. across the different submarkets. It seems like it held up pretty well, but there's also a decent amount of supply. So kind of what's your outlook for the back half of the year and into '24 in that market?Michael L. ManelisYes. So what's amazing about D.C. and even when you drill in by submarket, you really don't see a huge differential in our performance. And I think part of that is just when we talked about new supply coming into that market, they got such a great transit environment there, that supply really in any one of these submarkets can pull from other areas. So we really haven't seen any deviation of the performance across the submarkets. Now when you look forward to the balance of the year, like it was back half loaded for delivery. So we are aware that we're going to be facing more and more competitive supply. And it is fairly dispersed across some of these submarkets but again, I don't think we're forecasting to have like more pressure in 1 submarket than the other because of that transit environment that could pull from everywhere. The outlook for the balance of the year, it's still good, right? We're producing really strong revenue growth, good absorption of the supply, it may soften up a little bit, but I think we still have this momentum coming in. And I think it's positioned well for '24, even though you got another round of supply coming at you again. It's a market that's been demonstrating resilience and stability.James Colin FeldmanAnd there's been a lot of talk around the government not bringing certain agencies back to the office. Is that something that you -- that's kind of contemplated in the stats you're seeing already? Maybe those aren't really tenants that would be in your buildings? Or do you think that's a potential drag to come?Mark J. ParrellWell, it's Mark and Michael may add to this. I mean through the real estate roundtable there's been a lot of advocacy around that of trying to get federal workers back on the job. I'm hopeful that continues to push. The administration put something out. It wasn't very strong on that topic but we'll continue to push for that. I mean the federal government is such the key employer of course, in the metro, I mean implicitly in our guidance is not much of a change in the current reality on the ground, getting all those folks back in the office would be helpful. And I remind you, there is a difference between the type of employee. If you're in the national security world, you've likely been at the office the whole time. And as that group grows, there need to be closer in and closer into their office will continue to be relatively high. Again, I'm hopeful that we get -- there's been some action in Congress by the way, some bills introduced to get federal workers back in the office. So I'm hopeful that, that's a positive, but it isn't -- it's not inside of our guidance that we expect improvement. It's just a hope we have both, frankly, as taxpayers and as owners of real estate in D.C.James Colin FeldmanOkay. That's very helpful. And then I guess a similar question across submarkets in Seattle, where so far this cycle, we've seen major differences depending on where in the market assets are located or even [b] versus [a]. What are your thoughts there? And what do you think the implications are as these transit matter as much? Or how should we be thinking about your outlook there?Michael L. ManelisI mean for us right now, it's really like Belltown CBD is where you see the pressure, where you see the prices that are still materially off from where they were in March of 2020. The suburbs there feel good, right? It's not like great and robust, but they are healthy. So it's really just a suburban versus urban kind of differential that we see across that Seattle market. And when you think about the supply that's coming, it will impact not only urban, but also the suburban areas as well for next year in that market.OperatorOur next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho.Haendel Emmanuel St. JusteWanted to go back to the West Coast markets for a bit. Just curious if you could give us a bit more color on what you're seeing in terms of concessions maybe between San Fran, Seattle, parts of L.A. And then at a high level, what are your blended rate growth expectations for the West Coast versus East Coast markets in the back half of the year?Michael L. ManelisHaendel, this is Michael. So let me just -- I'll start with just the overall kind of concession use in the portfolio. Fairly consistent in the second quarter versus kind of the first quarter. Overall, we're running about 15% of the applications are receiving just about a month. About 80% of all the concessions that are being used are concentrated in the urban centers of both Seattle and San Francisco. In downtown San Francisco, it's about 50% of the applications are receiving about 6 weeks and in downtown Seattle, it's about 1/3 of the applications that are receiving just over a month. In terms of the spreads in the West Coast markets for new lease change, I don't know if I have that, kind of handy. I will tell you that right now, the East Coast markets have been outperforming the West Coast by about 400 basis points. My guess is that spread is going to stay fairly consistent, although you definitely have some movement in L.A. with some of the changes happening with bad debt.Haendel Emmanuel St. JusteThat's helpful. And where is the loss to lease in the portfolio today? And where is it highest and where is it lowest?Michael L. ManelisSure. So right now, the loss to lease is at 3.7% which for this time of the year is actually a little bit stronger than what we have seen historically. And maybe rather than like going by market around loss to lease, I could just kind of cluster them for you and group a few by a range. So like New York and San Diego have the highest loss to lease right now, which has been running about 9%. And then that's followed by like D.C., Orange County, Boston are all very tightly clustered in this like 4.5% to 6% range. And then you go to like the Denver, the San Francisco, Seattle and L.A. Those are all in like the flat to 2% and then I have my expansion markets of Dallas and Austin are the 2 markets right now that are in a gain to lease. I think when you put all of this into the blender, knowing where pricing trend is today, like I said, with that 6% growth from the beginning of the year, sitting with the 3.7 loss to lease, which is above kind of a normal year, it really does put us in a great position not only to finish out the year, but to have a starting point for '24, that's really above a norm.OperatorWe'll go next to Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.Alexander David GoldfarbHappy 30th anniversary. So 2 questions on -- both actually around acquisitions. So Mark, Sam used to talk about trading sardines and eating sardines. As you guys look at your experience in the -- especially in the urban markets, the bigger assets, do you see those assets in EQR going forward? Do you see them more as trading sardines or eating ones?Mark J. ParrellInteresting. I love that analogy out for a historical reference point. I mean these -- some of the markets like New York, if you want a presence in Midtown, the assets, by definition, are mostly large and costly, all right? So it's more of a market than a type decision, I would say. I think it's more likely that you'd see us sell a large asset because we just want to lower our market exposure there, not because we're particularly allergic to a large asset in the market, if it's not performed well or if we have an over concentration in a submarket, you'll see us sell it. So I guess I don't know what to do with that analogy in the sense that larger assets are harder to sell. We generally operate them pretty efficiently. We generally can run capital pretty efficiently to make up for that. But I don't have a sardine-type description for you. It's up to say that I think we'd sell if we don't like the spot, big or small asset.Alexander David GoldfarbI guess what I'm getting at is given the volatility that we've seen in the urban markets, do you think that it's better for EQR going forward to be more nimble and say, look, we have a base of assets that we like more in the suburbs where it's harder to get in, harder to get out, in the cities where you'll go up to a peak where you have record rents and it's easier to sell and then sort of trade around. That's what I'm trying to get at. If the urban markets are more like trading markets, versus long-term markets. So you're always trying to sort of arbitrage exposure.Mark J. ParrellI guess I don't agree with that. I'd start off by saying volatility in all sorts of assets and you're about to see volatility in the Sunbelt markets with these kind of prices. The fact that they're smaller assets just means that the prices just declined. I mean the way to protect against volatility in the market is to be in a position with your balance sheet and your strategy where you're not a compelled seller. So for us, volatility can mean opportunity, right? If prices go down enough, as I mentioned in my remarks in -- even in San Francisco, we'd be a buyer. So I just want to make that clear. For us, volatility is opportunity, not always a negative and the way we protect ourselves is by having a broader platform. So I think with the lesson we learned over the last 10, 15 years is a broader platform, means you can act more quickly in more markets and take advantage of those volatile moments where Austin, Texas trades cheap to long-term value and you're a buyer there or New York trades cheap and you're a buyer there. So I think as you see us balance the platform out, you're going to see us be more even more opportunistic. And I wouldn't shy away from buying a large asset. I think you just got to go with your eyes wide open about those assets being harder to sell. Is there something you'd add, Alex?Alexander BrackenridgeYes, Alex, this is Alex. I would just add that take Manhattan or actually Boston and D.C. really any of our urban markets to reproduce those portfolios will be virtually impossible. I mean Manhattan, I don't know how you'd find 25 really well-located assets in any amount of time. So we've got an unusual opportunity that we're taking advantage of today and you're seeing in Manhattan. It's the best performing market in the country. And you just couldn't decide all of a sudden you wanted to reproduce that.Alexander David GoldfarbOkay. And then the second question is, given it's a competitive market for transactions, we saw one of your peers do 2 large transactions that are basically neutral initially. Are there ways for you guys to enhance your initial yields, be it like buying it in the preferred or the [mezz] positions or junior positions? Or are there other ways that you can enhance your yield so that when you do close on a deal, it's more accretive than often, it seems like in REIT land, a transaction ends up being neutral year 1, and it's not until year 2 or 3 that we start to see the benefits?Mark J. ParrellYes. I'm going to split this up a little bit for the team to answer. I think I want to start by Alex talk about cap rates certainly matters a ton, but we also think a lot about replacement costs. And I'm going to ask Michael or Bob to just talk about platform scaling, margin expansion at EQR, those kinds of things, Alex, that can affect year 2 yields. Alex?Alexander BrackenridgeYes. So this is Alex. What we're really focused is being a very targeted buyer right now. And what we're targeting are opportunities, where as Mark says, there's a discount to replacement cost, but also a limited supply pipeline. So that typically has been out in the suburbs and those kinds of base. So if you're getting a good basis like that, that's the best thing for your investment in the long run rather than some kind of [mezz] piece that might be a little bit of financial engineering, getting it at a good basis is just irreplaceable.Michael L. ManelisYes. And I think from the operator standpoint, I think we have worked really hard over the last couple of years to build a platform that is highly scalable. So when we go into these markets, we're looking really at the ability to kind of leverage staff across properties, put them onto our platform, kind of put them into our pricing system. And it's clearly accretive from an operating margin for us when we're looking at underwriting these deals. Right now, when we look across these markets, any of the acquisitions we're looking at, we're saying even in our existing markets, what benefits do we get by bringing this into that portfolio, whether that's at a submarket level or the market as a whole?Mark J. ParrellYes. And I just think you've asked some great questions, Alex. I mean we're in a really good position where we've got teams in the markets, we can underwrite quickly, we can take over management quickly, but we're not overexposed to the supply. And there's going to be a lot that's going to be sold in the Sunbelt markets. And I think you should think not just about us selling some of these legacy urban assets and affecting, I'll call it, the numerator, but us making the company net bigger likely by using some of our debt capacity that Bob and his team have created so capably over the last few years to go out there and be a net buyer and I think what's more important to the management team and the Board is that per pound replacement cost discount. I think we're looking for the deals to make sense on an initial cap rate basis as well. But I mean the most important thing, most important signal to us historically has been buying at a meaningful discount to replication cost. And in an environment where construction costs are high and they might be flat for a year or so, but they're likely not going to decline in our opinion much, you can get a discount to basis, you got a little moat around your asset. I like everything about that. So I think that's what you'll hear us talk about if we're fortunate to see some assets out there to buy in these expansion markets and in the suburbs of our existing markets.OperatorWe'll go next to Michael Goldsmith with UBS.Michael GoldsmithMy first question is on bad debt. Can you provide some context in terms of what's included or implied that happens to bad debt in the back half of the year in your updated guidance?Robert A. GarechanaYes. So good question, Michael, it's Bob. So in the back half of the year, we will actually finally switch to bad debt, helping with a growth rate by about 30 basis points. And the reason is because we continue to see that sequential improvement of bad debt, and we'll cross over the difficult comparable period that relates to the rental relief payments we had in the prior year. That accretion or that benefit to total revenue growth is likely not going to occur until the fourth quarter because in the third quarter of 2022, you still had elevated rental relief but we think we'll cross over there. We think at least by the end of the year, when you look at the full year basis, we'll end the year around call it, 125, 130 basis points as a percentage of total revenue and bad debt, which is still elevated relative to the historical norm of 50 basis points and leave the opportunity for more contribution to growth as you go into 2024.Michael GoldsmithGot it. And my second question is more of a strategic question. Arguably, you have one of, if not the best positioned portfolios for the market right now, given the strength in coastal, urban areas and then we consistently are being told that you're looking to have a more balanced portfolio between urban and suburban, coastal and Sunbelt. So can you just talk a little bit about like how should investors reconcile kind of the strength of the portfolio now to kind of the overall strategy of diversifying away from what's working right now?Mark J. ParrellYes. Great. Great question, very fair. I think you're going to see the baton kind of path. So I think for a few years, these Sunbelt markets are going to be pretty stressed. And I think a lot of the owners of these assets aren't long-term owners, they're developers with [impatient] capital, expensive development debt. And we can buy those properties again for a good basis as we just discussed and add them to the portfolio. I think our kind of resident is increasingly in some of the Sunbelt markets. But yet the coastal markets have real supply advantages that you're seeing right now. So creating a real balanced portfolio for our investors, I think for the next year or so, they're going to benefit from just better coastal dynamics on the supply and demand side. I think after a while, those things will even out. And I think they have a portfolio that year in and year out outperforms not just in certain periods, but year in and year out. It just requires more balance between urban, suburban and coastal and Sunbelt, and we're really balancing the demand and supply risks and opportunities. We're thinking a lot about regulatory risk. And we're thinking a bunch about resilience. The cost, for example, of insurance in Florida, the cost of casualty, repairs and things like that are getting more significant. So I think as we talk to our investors, and I think this has been well received and the instruction we've received from the Board is to again, try and create this portfolio that's a little more balanced as to opportunities and risks. And I think what our investors will get are hopefully gleaning numbers for the next, I don't know how many quarters, 18 months to 24 months. And then hopefully, at some point, we'll start to see supply abate and these other new markets, and we'll be there to take advantage of that, having purchased at an attractive basis. So in my hopes and dreams, that's how it would play out.OperatorOur last question comes from the line of Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley.Adam KramerI think you've done a really good job of kind of presenting pricing trends on a kind of a seasonal or sequential basis historically. Thinking about Slide 24 in your most recent deck, for example. Just wondering, thinking about kind of the late summer months and into the fall, maybe just walk us through your assumptions for kind of growth relative to the normal seasonal pattern.Michael L. ManelisAdam, this is Michael. So I think what we've said is we expected this year to follow normal seasonal trends, both on a rent seasonality, a demand seasonality and right now -- and we said it was going to be a little bit muted. We didn't expect rents to peak quite as high as what they would normally peak. Right now, we're doing kind of right where we thought we would be, turning the corner, heading into August. We would expect, just given the application volume and the foot traffic we're seeing that we've got several weeks left of what I would say is the peak leasing season where we'll continue to inch up a little bit of rate and then as you turn the corner and you walk your way in through September, we do expect that rates will start to moderate a little bit. We have so many years of data. We're looking at all of these stats, and we haven't really seen anything that tells us not to expect that normal kind of softening that occurs in the late third quarter and into the fourth quarter, both from the pricing trend standpoint, little bit on the occupancy standpoint. But right now, we feel pretty good because of the Southern California situation that occupancy will continue to improve and be stable for us for the year. So I just think you just got to look through all of those stats and just put yourself into a bell curve and allow both rent seasonality and demand seasonality to kind of tail off in the third -- late third quarter and fourth quarter. That's what we're modeling. We've seen years clearly where we've been able to defy that and hold the line with rate or have good demand kind of going all the way through the fourth quarter. I just don't have any insight right now to say that this is going to be the year that does that.Adam KramerThat's super helpful. I really appreciate that color. And then I guess it's frankly kind of a similar question. But thinking about back earlier in the year, I think you guys put out a kind of 2.5% market rent growth forecast for the full year. Wondering if at this point in the year, kind of knowing what you know, half year results in so far, would you make any kind of changes to that number? Or is that kind of still how you think about for the full year on average, 2.5% market rate growth?Michael L. ManelisSo Adam, this is Michael again. No, I think we're like -- we're running right at it. Like we're right on top of these numbers. I think that market rate growth you layer on top of where our embedded growth was in the beginning of the year, our ability to capture the loss to lease and then you had that intra-period growth. You put all of that stuff into the blender together and it was pointing us to this like 4% blended rate growth for the year. And right now, that's like exactly where we're headed. So I wouldn't change that number or outlook at all.OperatorThis does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mark Parrell. Please go ahead.Mark J. ParrellThanks, Ruth. Thank you all for your time and interest in Equity Residential today. Enjoy the rest of your summer, and we look forward to seeing many of you out on the fall conference circuit.

2023-07-30,"It’s nice to own stocks that are well-positioned to rally and pay you for waiting for them to do so. That’s especially true for older investors who want to buy stocks, and generate income. Even better, companies with significant dividends usually have strong, stable businesses. As a result, dividend stocks tend to be a good fit for conservative investors. With that said, here are seven of the best dividend stocks to buy now.Best Dividend Stocks: Volkswagen (VWAGY)stock market ticker screen with the word ""dividends"" appearing in large text. discounted dividend stocksSource: iQoncept/shutterstock.comGerman automaker V0lkswagen (OTC:VWAGY) boasts a 5.6% dividend yield. And the company’s top line surged 18% last quarter, year over year. Plus, in the first half of the year, operating profits surged 13% to 13.9 billion euros. Boding well for the company’s long-term outlook, its deliveries of electric vehicles soared 50% year-over-year in the first half of 2023.Additionally, I’m bullish on Volkswagen’s decision to partner with two Chinese automaker, SAIC and Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV). Partnering with these firms will increase Volkswagen’s chances of developing models that appeal to Chinese consumers, since the Chinese automakers likely have a deeper understanding of the local market than the German automaker does. Further, as I’ve noted in past columns, Xpeng is a leader in advanced driver assistance systems.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBest Dividend Stocks: Intel (INTC)A photo of a paper with a chart and the word ""Dividends"" written on it, with a pen and calculator resting on top of it.Source: jittawit21/Shutterstock.comIntel’s (NYSE:INTC) dividend yield is only 1.4%. But, with the chip maker’s business on the comeback trail and boasting multiple, positive, long-term catalysts,  I would not be surprised if the firm meaningfully raises its payout in a year or two.The sales of Intel’s largest business, its Client Computing unit, jumped to $6.8 billion in Q2 from $5.8 billion in Q1. And the revenue generated by its Data Center and AI business increased to $4 billion last quarter from $3.7 billion in Q1. Also encouragingly, the sales of the company’s chip manufacturing business climbed 307% year-over-year to $232 million. I expect the company to become a big beneficiary of the AI revolution.Story continuesBest Dividend Stocks: GSK (GSK)A hand reaches out of a mailbox holding a wad of cash.Source: ShutterstockGSK (NYSE:GSK) has a hefty dividend yield of 3.86%.The company has multiple, rapidly growing vaccines and treatments, including its cervical cancer vaccine, its shingles vaccine, and its HIV drugs. Moreover, GSK’s RSV vaccine and one of its cancer treatments, Jemperli, look poised to be blockbusters.Despite all of these positive drivers, GSK stock has a very low forward price-earnings ratio of just 9.3. I think that’s because investors were worried about the lawsuits the company faced over Zantac. However, a federal judge earlier this year dismissed all of the federal lawsuits related to the drug, and GSK was able to settle one of the first lawsuits against it in a state court over the drug. Given these points, I don’t expect GSK to be badly hurt by the litigation over Zantac.IBM (IBM)sheet of paper marked ""dividends"" with a $20 bill on top of it to represent dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockIBM (NYSE:IBM) has an enticing dividend yield of 4.7%.In a previous article,  I noted that the company had unveiled Watson X, which Barron’s calls “new software platform for building enterprise AI models and applications. ”Moreover, an analyst referred to Watson X as a potential “blockbuster.” Not long after, more than 150 enterprises, including Citi and NASA , were already using the system. Also noteworthy, Bank of America said IBM’s AI business is taking off, noting that the number of consulting deals it signed had rise 24% last quarter versus the same period a year earlier.Speaking of last quarter, the revenue of OpenShift, IBM’s hybrid cloud platform, soared over 30% YOY in Q2 “and now has $1.1 billion in annual recurring revenue, CFO Jim Kavanaugh reported. Analysts, on average, expect the company’s earnings per share to climb to $10.05 in 2024 versus $9.13 in 2022. Given these points and the fact that the shares have a low forward price-earnings ratio of 15, I view IBM as one of the best dividend stocks to buy now.Restaurant Brands International (QSR)The word ""dividend"" highlighted in a dictionary.Source: ShutterstockRestaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR) has a 2.8% dividend yield. Starting in the latter half of 2022, I became upbeat on QSR stock due to the popularity of its restaurants. Later, I became even more enthused after it hired Patrick Doyle, the brains behind Domino Pizza’s (NYSE:DPZ) turnaround.In May, QSR showed that my faith in it was not misplaced, as it reported that its revenue had soared 9.7% in the first quarter versus the same period a year earlier, while its global comparable sales jumped 10% year-over-year. Further, its BITDA, excluding certain items and acquisitions, increased  15.6% to $588 million.General Motors (GM)dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) only has a 1% dividend yield. But given the strength of its recent financial results and of the U.S. auto market, I believe that the automaker is likely to raise its payout.On July 25, GM delivered “beat and raise results” for the second quarter, as its bottom line jumped 52% versus the same period a year earlier and the firm ” increased its 2023 sales guidance to $12 billion – $14 billion from $11 billion – $13 billion.” Wall Street appears to have been pleased with the results. Also importantly,. GM should benefit from the strengthening U.S. auto market, while it’s making significant strides when it comes to electric vehicles and autonomous vehicles.Darden Restaurants (DRI)Darden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI) has an attractive dividend yield of 3%. The company owns multiple, iconic restaurant chains, including Olive Garden, Bahama Breeze, and Longhorn Steakhouse.On June 22, the company reported strong fiscal fourth quarter results. Specifically, its revenue climbed 6.4% versus the same period a year earlier, while its earnings per share jumped 15% year-over-year and its same restaurant sales increased 4% YOY.While I do expect the growth of spending on vacations to slow, I believe that the continued, strong labor market will enable U.S. consumers to continue to spend a great deal of money on eating out. Of course, DRI is likely to benefit from that trend going forward. Analysts, on average, expect DRI’s EPS to climb by an impressive average of 9% in each of the next five years.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer was long XPEV and INTC.

2023-07-31,"(Adds shares in paragraph 3, details throughout)July 31 (Reuters) - Medical device maker Baxter International has issued an urgent correction for certain software versions of its infusion pumps that deliver fluids into a patient's body, the U.S. drug regulator said on Monday.The correction has been issued due to an increase in reported false blockage alarms following the software upgrades in SIGMA Spectrum and Spectrum IQ infusion pumps, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said.Shares of the company, which manufactures dialysis products and infusion pumps, fell 2.5% in morning trade.The false alarm may lead to an interruption or delay of therapy, and Baxter has received three reports of serious injury potentially associated with this issue, the regulator said.The company is contacting affected customers to schedule the software reversion, the FDA said, adding that they can continue to use the devices by following certain on-screen instructions to troubleshoot the issue.Baxter did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for a comment.(Reporting by Mariam Sunny in Bengaluru; Editing by Shilpi Majumdar)"
2023-08-01,"Mettler-Toledo International Inc. (NYSE:MTD) shareholders might be concerned after seeing the share price drop 16% in the last quarter. But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last five years have been very strong. In fact, the share price is 114% higher today. We think it's more important to dwell on the long term returns than the short term returns. Ultimately business performance will determine whether the stock price continues the positive long term trend.While this past week has detracted from the company's five-year return, let's look at the recent trends of the underlying business and see if the gains have been in alignment. See our latest analysis for Mettler-Toledo International While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Over half a decade, Mettler-Toledo International managed to grow its earnings per share at 22% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 16% over the same period. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe're pleased to report that the CEO is remunerated more modestly than most CEOs at similarly capitalized companies. It's always worth keeping an eye on CEO pay, but a more important question is whether the company will grow earnings throughout the years. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Mettler-Toledo International's earnings, revenue and cash flow.A Different PerspectiveMettler-Toledo International shareholders are down 6.9% for the year, but the market itself is up 12%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 16%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Mettler-Toledo International better, we need to consider many other factors. Case in point: We've spotted   1 warning sign for Mettler-Toledo International  you should be aware of.Story continuesBut note: Mettler-Toledo International may not be the best stock to buy.

Going by our model, the the projection for the Healthcare segment’s second-quarter organic growth was 5.8%.Revenues at AST improved 6% to $233.1 million (up 5% on a CER organic basis).

If you want to skip our detailed discussion about the seasonal impact on the stock market, head directly to 5 Best Summer Stocks To Buy Now.While the temperature rises and students get geared up for their much awaited summer break, investors get to work. One of the best performing seasonal sectors in 2023 is hospitality and tourism. Mastercard Economics Institute reported that global leisure and business travel experienced a year-over-year growth rate of 42% between 2022 and 2023. For the first three months of 2023, in the UAE alone, leisure activities have increased by roughly 50%, as compared to the same period in 2022. In addition to this, the travel and entertainment spending by small businesses has increased by 49% in the MENA region as well.

As a reminder, this call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the call over to Chief Financial Officer of EOG Resources, Mr. Tim Driggers. Please go ahead, sir.Timothy K. DriggersThank you. Good morning, and thanks for joining us. This conference call includes forward-looking statements.

Here is Ezra.Story continuesEzra Y. YacobThanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results reflect exceptional execution throughout our multi-basin portfolio. Production volumes, CapEx, cash operating costs and DD&A all beat targets driving another quarter of excellent financial performance. We earned $1.5 billion of adjusted net income and generated $1 billion of free cash flow. Year-to-date, we have generated free cash flow of $2.1 billion. That free cash flow and cash on the balance sheet funded year-to-date cash return to shareholders of $2.2 billion, including more than $600 million of share repurchases executed during the first half of the year. Taking into account our full year regular dividend, we have committed to return $3.1 billion to shareholders in 2023 or about 67% of our estimated 2023 cash flow, assuming a $75 oil price, well ahead of our target minimum return of 60%. EOG's peer-leading regular dividend is currently the majority of the $3.1 billion of cash return committed to shareholders this year. Our sustainable growing regular dividend, which we have never cut nor suspended remains the first priority to return cash. We also continue to leverage special dividends and buybacks to return additional cash depending on market conditions. Through the first 2 quarters of 2023, we have deployed more than $600 million to opportunistically repurchase shares during times of increased volatility. And while our cash return strategy remains consistent, what has evolved since putting the $5 billion repurchase authorization in place over 1.5 years ago is the fundamental strength of our business, and we continue to get better through relentless execution of and commitment to EOG's value proposition. We invest in high-return projects across our multi-basin portfolio, adding lower-cost reserves, which reduces our breakevens and expands our margins. We are now active -- actively investing in 5 premium basins more than any time in our history. Our foundational assets in the Delaware Basin and Eagle Ford continue to consistently deliver and we are pleased by the outstanding progress across our emerging Southern Powder River Basin, Ohio Utica Combo and South Texas Dorado place. Well productivity and cost performance are meeting or beating expectations across our portfolio as we invest and develop each asset at a pace that supports consistent execution and continued innovation. We continue to lower the cost basis of our company, utilizing technology and innovation that improves well performance and lowers well costs to sustainably reduce our finding and development costs. efficiencies and infrastructure investments are lowering current and future unit operating costs and contribute to our emissions reduction efforts. And finally, we have further strengthened our pristine balance sheet this year. while generating significant free cash flow and funding our transparent cash return strategy, which is designed to deliver consistent shareholder value through the cycle. And heading into the second half of 2023, our continued performance gains will be complemented by strong fundamentals. Oil demand has been resilient despite volatility in the first half of the year, and demand is showing signs of continued growth through the second half of the year. Strong inventory draws since the start of the year pulled oil inventories below 5-year averages and refinery utilization remains high. Production growth in the U.S. is on pace to deliver similar rates as 2022, while exiting the year with significantly less activity as public companies continue to demonstrate discipline, and it appears OPEC+ are following through on announced production cuts. The culmination of these actions should further reduce inventory levels in place upward pressure on pricing through year-end. Regarding North American natural gas, while inventory levels remain above the 5-year average, prices have firmed up recently, reflecting a reduction in natural gas drilling and an increase in demand from both power generation and LNG exports. These trends should support a more balanced supply and demand environment late this year and heading into 2024. We remain constructive on the longer-term gas story for the U.S., supported by recent LNG project approvals and the growing petrochemical complex on the Gulf Coast, and we are especially pleased with Dorado's place in the market as one of the lowest cost supplies of natural gas in the U.S. with an advantaged location and emissions profile. EOG's value proposition is delivering results and the strength of our business has never been better to deliver value for the shareholders through industry cycles and play a leading role in the long-term future of energy. Now here's Tim to review our financial position.Timothy K. DriggersThanks, Ezra. EOG delivered excellent operating and financial performance in all areas in the second quarter. Oil production increased 3% year-over-year, while total production increased 5%. Per unit cash operating costs remained essentially flat from the prior year period despite industry-wide inflation. Compared to the first quarter, however, per unit cash operating cost declined by 5% and were lower in all 4 categories. We're beginning to see the benefits of lower costs, improve our operating margin. The DD&A rate fell by 10% year-over-year, driven by the addition of reserves at lower finding costs compared to our production base. Capital expenditures came in at $1.5 billion, $130 million below our target and just slightly above the first quarter level. The difference was mostly due to the timing of non well-related costs such as infrastructure projects. Year-to-date, CapEx of $3 billion is 50% of the full year budget. The improving capital efficiency of our assets consistent operational execution, along with the application of the innovation and technology to lower cost is making a big impact on the financial performance of the company. We earned adjusted net income of $2.49 per share in the second quarter and generated free cash flow of $1 billion. Return on capital employed for the last 12 months is 29% and at an average WTI oil price of $81 and Henry Hub natural gas price of about $5. Here's Billy to review operations.Lloyd W. HelmsThanks, Tim. I would like to first thank our employees for their commitment and dedication that led to another quarter of exceptional execution. EOG once again meet our forecasted targets and delivered a near-perfect quarter. As a result, we have completed the first half of the year ahead of volumes and ahead on total per unit cash operating cost. Our volume performance in the first half of the year is due to several factors. The performance of new wells is outpacing our forecast, primarily in the Delaware Basin, part of which is due to our new completion design. We are also experiencing less downtime due to market interruptions than previously planned. Our investments in infrastructure, along with real-time data analytics, provided the control and flexibility needed to redirect sales volumes to different markets to maintain production. Unit cash operating costs through the first half of the year averaged 5% below the midpoint of our quarterly guidance. due to the combination of several factors, including lower lease operating expenses as well as reduced transportation costs. Lower workover and compression-related expense reduced LOE while transportation costs benefited from the flexibility to sell into more favorable markets throughout the quarter. Credit goes to the cross-functional efforts of our production, marketing and information systems teams who remain focused on sustainable low-cost operations quarter after quarter. We have line of sight to maintain these cost improvements throughout the year and as a result, have reduced our full year guidance for total unit cash operating costs. Operationally, EOG is firing on all cylinders. Our foundational Eagle Ford and Delaware Basin plays are delivering exceptional results. While our emerging plays benefit from learnings and technology transfer across our multi-basin portfolio. Our decentralized structure supports innovation in each operating area, which function much like independent technology incubators and compounds the impact of that innovation by taking ideas born in one area and expanding them across multiple basins and across multiple functions. Across every operating area, our frontline engineers and geologists work the technology every day to lower cost and improve well performance. We look for strategic opportunities to vertically integrate certain services within the supply chain where we find an opportunity to better align those services with our goals. That includes areas like downhole drilling motors, drilling mud, sand, and water. Developing such capabilities in-house significantly improves the cost structure of the company. This quarter, we are highlighting drilling performance improvements in the South Texas, Dorado; South Powder River Basin, Mowry; and the Ohio Utica Combo plays. Our emerging players are moving up the learning curve faster due to the benefit of drilling advancements and the application of technology over the past decade. We continue to evolve our proprietary suite of applications powered by real-time high-frequency data and analytics to assist our frontline employees to collaborate and make decisions faster. The combined benefit of these efforts has already contributed to an increase of up to 25% in drilling feet per day for wells in our emerging plays this year. In our Ohio Utica play, we recently drilled a 15,700-foot lateral in 2.6 days and 100% in zone. Capital expenditures for the first half are also running light, due primarily to the infrastructure spend that has been deferred into the second half of the year. It is worth noting the economic impact of our investments in EOG-owned infrastructure. Our realized U.S. oil price in the second quarter was $1.23 above WTI and U.S. natural gas was essentially flat to Henry Hub. CapEx for our drilling and completion program are right on track. The rate of change for inflation this year is consistent with what we had anticipated at the start of the year. So we still see line of sight to limit year-over-year well cost inflation in '23 to just 10%. While any additional softening of service cost to this year has the potential to impact 2024, it's simply too early to predict. The market remains too dynamic particularly given the constructive outlook for oil in the second half of the year. Furthermore, we remain focused on generating long-term sustainable cost reductions driven by utilizing the highest quality equipment and the highest performing teams, which are less exposed to the leading-edge price declines that we see in more marginal equipment. Our $6 billion capital program is focused -- is forecasted to deliver 3% oil volume growth and 6% total liquids growth. In Dorado, our South Texas natural gas play, we delayed the timing of planned completions earlier this year and about 5 wells have been pushed into early 2024. Thus, we reduced our full year gas volume guidance accordingly. We maintained our drilling pace in Dorado to build operational momentum and capture the corresponding efficiencies. As a result, we are seeing a 16% improvement in our drilling times for Dorado as shown on Slide 11 of our updated investor presentation. We are constructive on natural gas longer term and believe Dorado will be one of the lowest cost and lowest emission supplies of natural gas in the U.S. and will compete on a global scale. This year started out with many challenges, but also many opportunities to continue to improve the company. I'm very pleased with the progress our teams continue to deliver and remain optimistic about the second half of the year, and how the company is positioned for the future. Now I'll turn the call over to Ken to discuss progress on lowering our emissions.Kenneth W. BoedekerThanks, Billy. We're continuing to make outstanding progress on our emissions goals. As a preview to our 2022 Sustainability Report that will be published in September, we are excited to announce that we've reached 3 significant near-term goals well ahead of schedule: first, our 2022 GHG intensity rate of 13.3 metric tons of CO2e per MBOE is less than our 2025 goal of 13.5; second, our 2022 methane emissions percentage is 0.04% of our natural gas produced and is significantly less than our 2025 goal of 0.06%; and third, we have achieved our zero routine flaring goal in 2023, well ahead of our 2025 target and significantly ahead of the World Bank initiative which drives to attain zero routine flaring by 2030. We have also confirmed that our wellhead gas capture rate for 2022 was 99.9% of the gas produced. We continue to expand our in-house continuous methane monitoring technology named iSense, and finished 2022 with 95% of our production in the Delaware Basin covered by iSense monitoring. As a reminder, the power of iSense is incorporating continuous methane monitoring data with our production and facilities data and monitoring this data on a 24-hour basis in 1 of our 4 control centers. This enhances our ability to identify potential leaks and prioritize repairs that are needed in the field to minimize fugitive emissions. As with a number of EOG operations, it is anticipated that collection and integration of iSense data will lead to continuous improvement in facilities and production design and operations. We're excited about the progress we've made in the last several years on our emissions performance and are very proud that we have such dedicated employees who are continually making our operations more efficient. Their innovative solutions and push to beat expectations have driven us to exceed our goals early. We are currently assessing new goals with our operations groups and anticipate publicizing those goals in the first half of 2024. Now here's Ezra to wrap up.Ezra Y. YacobThanks, Ken. Our second quarter results demonstrate once again that EOG's value proposition works. We invest in high-return, low-cost assets across a diverse multi-basin portfolio. We leverage technology and innovation to sustainably lower well costs and reduce emissions. These high-return, low-cost investments generate significant free cash flow to fund our transparent cash return strategy backstopped by a pristine balance sheet to deliver consistent shareholder value through the cycle. Most importantly, our culture is at the core of our value proposition and is our ultimate competitive advantage. Thanks for listening. We'll now go to Q&A.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Paul Cheng of Scotiabank.Paul ChengEzra, can you hear me okay?Ezra Y. YacobYes, sir. Paul, go ahead, please.Paul ChengTwo questions, please. First, on the cash return on the free cash flow, thank you that you are paying more than 100%. But just want to see how you determine that this is the wait time to pay more than 100%, or how should we [reset] into the future given you're already in a net cash position, should we think that there's a little bit change in the management view and the payout is going to perhaps closer to 100% until that maybe that market condition change. And also that whether we should read the second consecutive quarter of the buyback means that management now see the buyback as more of an ongoing part of the toolbox on your cash return? That's the first question. Second question that on Dorado, the decision that -- to delay the 5 well in this year. Can you maybe share with us, I think Billy had mentioned that, but can you share with us then what's the thinking behind the delay? I know that the Street has been bucking you that you should delay the Dorado, and you guys do it in this quarter, but I want to understand a little bit better in terms of the decision-making process behind. And the full year guidance reduction, I think it's all related to that, right?Ezra Y. YacobSure, Paul. This is Ezra. I think I'll take that first question and then Billy can address the second question regarding Dorado. So yes, on the first one, it's kind of a broad question on our cash return strategy. So hopefully, I hit on all the points that you're trying to get at. But first, let's start with our guidance, which has always been the minimum of 60% of free cash flow. So we've never guided to that 60% as being a specific target. It's always been a minimum of 60% of our free cash flow. And the reason we like that guide is, honestly, it's pretty simple and dynamic. It's easy to understand and communicate the minimum of 60% is -- it can be supported over a range of price scenarios, especially when there's a pullback in prices. And really, we can underpin that with the growing sustainable regular dividend that we highlight and talk about so much. And that's what can provide really a meaningful amount of cash return through the cycle. Again, I do want to emphasize, we consider that regular dividend to still be the true hallmark of a strong and improving underlying business, and we like the message that it sends. We increased that regular dividend commensurate with the strength of the business, lowering the cost basis of the company and also in consideration with strengthening our balance sheet. More specifically to kind of payouts that you've seen this year. We do recognize the value of opportunistic buybacks as part of that cash return strategy is a way to create shareholder value. So I would say that really, the decision that you've seen is consistent with our overall capital allocation strategy where we buy back shares in an opportunistic manner as a means to return cash above and beyond that minimum of 60%. In addition, to our regular dividend and at times, instead of paying a special dividend. We basically evaluate that buyback, just like we do any of our other investment decisions, whether it's exploration or drilling high-return oil and gas wells or investing in infrastructure. It's how is that investment going to create long-term shareholder value. That's what we primarily focus on. And so the percent will fluctuate depending on a specific moment in time and what the circumstances are around our cash return strategy. But what we have guided to and what you can bank on is it's the minimum of 60% now. We highlighted -- we paid 67% out last year, and we're very well positioned halfway through the year right now where we've already committed or paid 67%, as I highlighted in the script. And all -- for the Dorado timing, I'll hand it over to Billy.Lloyd W. HelmsYes. Paul. On Dorado, we had indicated earlier in the year that we were evaluating the potential to delay some of our completions in Dorado and we are consistent with that strategy. We elected to maintain our drilling operations there, and we're seeing the benefits of that decision to play through the efficiencies we're gaining on the operational side. And we've given some color on that in our new investor deck illustrating the improvements in drilling times there in that place. So we're very pleased with that progress. But don't forget, our investment strategy includes a gas price of investing for $2.50. That's our premium price deck when it relates to gas prices. We certainly were watching inventory levels on the gas side and just prudently decided to delay a little bit of the completions there until we saw the fundamentals improve, and so we'll be just laying some of those completions as we go into the late this year, which pushes 5 wells into the next year. So that's simply the thinking on that.OperatorOur next question comes from Neal Dingmann of Truist.Neal David DingmannNice quarter. Ezra, my question is on well productivity, specifically looking at that Slide 10 of yours, certainly it appears that your Delaware's wells continue to notably improve, and so what I'm wondering is this driven more by just continued D&C efficiencies? Or is it more an informational targeting? I asked that. I just was looking at the bottom through the left corner of those pies. It looks like over the years, not only the wells improving, but it looks like they're becoming more focus on that Wolfcamp oil. So I'm just wondering what is driving that, but it does look very positive.Ezra Y. YacobThank you, Neal. This is Ezra. I'm actually going to let Jeff Leitzell step in and address your question.Jeffrey R. LeitzellHi, Neal. This is Jeff. On our Permian productivity, we've been really happy with how the wells have performed in the Delaware through the first half of the year. So all of our primary targets, they're performing right now as forecasted or better. And I'd say this is primarily due to just our stacked pay co-development strategy in combination with the new completion design we talked about, which has continued to be really successful in our Wolfcamp targets. And in regards to that new completion design, just kind of a quick update, we're still observing a 20% increase in both first year production and EUR for both oil and BOEs in the Wolfcamp. So for the full year of 2023, we're planning on bringing on about 70 total Wolfcamp wells with this new design, which is nearly twice the number we've completed in 2022. And also with it, as we talked about, we're continuing to test and expand the technique in other areas and targets in the Delaware Basin along with all across our emerging plays in our multi-basin portfolio.Neal David DingmannIt's very helpful. And then -- and sorry about that. My second question is just on OFS costs. In the past, you all have been among the best not only just what I would say renegotiating contracts, but I know in the past, you've been able to stockpile tight at the right time and all those sort of things. I'm just wondering, is -- maybe give us a little bit of details on how you see the market now?Lloyd W. HelmsYes, Neal. This is Billy. So certainly, we're seeing the service prices start to soften. But these savings from lower service costs really probably won't manifest into a lower well cost until later this year and certainly into 2024. These leading-edge prices are falling across various products and services for the industry. And certainly, it varies depending on the product in the area. I'd add that there are several factors that kind of reflect kind of where our '23 capital program is. As a company, as you mentioned there, we focused on sustainable cost reductions through our operational efficiency gains. As a result, we do seek out the highest performing equipment in crews, super-spec rigs, electric frac fleets, et cetera. That's really less exposed to some of these headline inflation numbers that we're seeing on the more marginal and equipments on the spot market. And the second part of that is we really anticipate that service costs would moderate through the year when we put our plan together since you know rig count really peaked back in November, and we built our plan in February, expecting well costs would increase no more than 10% relative to this last year. So things are really playing out exactly the way we planned. Another point there is we do try to secure about 50% of our well costs in the start of any given year that really helps insulate us from inflationary impacts to our activity levels. And then lastly, based on how we do manage our business, we are less exposed to the volatility in service cost in any given year. And I would remind you, as you kind of alluded to there, our well cost really only increased about 7% last year compared to the over 20% inflation that we saw in the market. So yes, it really helps us kind of manage our activity level with confidence as we go through the year. And we'll certainly remained flexible as we look into next year to see how we can position ourselves for next year.OperatorOur next question comes from Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan.Arun JayaramI was wondering if you could help us think about the second half oil production profile for EOG. It looks like your updated guidance points to a slight sequential decline in 3Q. And I just wanted to get some thoughts on to hit if there's still kind of confidence in hitting the midpoint of the oil guidance range because that would imply fourth quarter oil production number in the mid 480s to upper 480s. So help us think about the sequential movement in volumes in the second half of the year?Lloyd W. HelmsYes, Arun, this is Billy. Yes, I think the thing to keep in mind is we do operate in more than 1 basin and multiple plays, and we have varying sizes of well packages in each play. So the timing of really the quarter-to-quarter variance in production is really driven by the timing on a quarter-to-quarter basis of how these packages across different plays come online. And even within the quarter, how that varies month-to-month within the quarter can vary -- can drive the volume profile. And I would remind you, and I just ask you to go back and look at the change from the first quarter to the second quarter, it's actually larger than what you're seeing in the forecast from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. So we would -- we are maintaining ratable activity throughout the year and just as a matter of simply timing on bringing on some of these larger packages. So, so far this year, we've either met or exceeded our volume forecast and have complete confidence in being able to meet the midpoint of our guidance.Arun JayaramGreat. Just a follow-up, I wanted to get some thoughts on the Ohio Utica. One of the midstream providers highlighted how they're building out, call it, a backbone in the Utica looks like you may be the anchor E&P for that investment. But I'd love to get some thoughts on the Utica. We did see that you maybe pulled your TIL guidance down a little bit this year, but just an update would be helpful.D. Lance TerveenArun, this is Lance. Yes, I would say what we're most focused on right now is just getting all the midstream infrastructure in place. So we do have 2 ongoing projects that are going on. We've got 1 in the north and then another one in the South as well. So what we're really focused on is linking our production to the available processing capacity. And really, what's happening is it's a consistent strategy that we've done in all are plays, where we're going to have a balance of EOG-owned infrastructure along with strong relationships with really good working third parties. We're going to need both in the Utica Combo up there. And so right now, just focused on setting up 2024 and beyond with the infrastructure.Kenneth W. BoedekerYes, Arun, this is Ken. I just want to give you a quick update on the Utica. We're making excellent progress on that program this year. We do plan to bring a 4-well package online this month and our frac crew will be starting up again in a few weeks. So the wells we drilled and completed in 2022, we do continue to deliver our expected performance, and we also continue to add acreage and look for additional low-cost opportunities to add to our position up there.OperatorOur next question comes from Doug Leggate of Bank of America.Douglas George Blyth LeggateEzra, it's a long time since we had to worry about the U.S. growing too quickly and all the whole market share battle issues that we all lived through over the last 4, 5 years with OPEC. But in your opening remarks, you did talk about Saudi's decision to support the price or extended cuts. So I'm wondering when you sit in the boardroom and you look at what is an artificially high oil price because Saudi is cutting production arguably to support price. How do you think about what that means for your business, the appropriate level of spending the right allocation of one could call it, windfall cash flow because it's not -- it's an artificially supported price by definition. So I'm just curious how you think about what that means to your business your cash flow is basically being subsidized again by Saudi.Ezra Y. YacobDoug, Thanks for the question. This is Ezra. Yes, it's a dynamic environment, right? We had a large SPR release last year that increased the inventory levels kind of entering this year. And as those have started to come down, now they're going to start all indications that they're going to start coming down significantly faster because OPEC+, as I said, it looks like they are going to support their cuts to kind of bring those inventory levels down. So your point is, it's a very interesting one, and it's one we discuss regularly, obviously, and we do different scenarios around. So in general, what I'd say is, on this year, what we look at is whether it's crude, products, gasoline, distillates, either globally or domestically, inventory levels are basically in the lower half of a 5-year range. Now that's a choppy 5 years, like we said, because of 2020 with COVID and then, of course, with 2020 with half of the year being exceptionally low and then half of the year being somewhat artificially higher with the SPR. Outside of the last month, the last month, we've seen kind of gasoline and distillate demand being just a bit weaker domestically. But otherwise, products demand has really been in line all year with our expectations. Crude demand, has continued to increase, continue to grow. And not only with the high inventory levels that we entered the year with, but really supply, I think, has surprised everybody a little bit to the upside. And it's not necessarily, as you pointed out, U.S. growth or new barrels, but it's really historically displaced barrels that are back online. And dominantly, what I'm talking about is Venezuela and Iran, and maybe a little bit of -- I think everyone has been a little bit surprised at least we have on the resiliency of the Russian barrels to hit the market. So we don't forecast those as having a significant longer-term effect. And one thing that we think about when we talk about the spare capacity that's now offline with OPEC+ is some of that spare capacity is really offsetting the previous spare capacity I just highlighted from Venezuela and Iran. So it is a little bit different from prior years. Ultimately, what we see is the increasing oil demand overall exiting this year, most estimates have it at least at [102] to exit the year, which would put us at a significantly high point. Now to your ultimate question on how we actually look at that internally, our planning begins with everything we just talked about kind of an evaluation of the macro environment with respect to supply and demand fundamentals, including spare capacity that's off-line just by choice and spare capacity that's off-line for true geopolitical reasons. But then more than that, Doug, it really does come down to evaluating across all of our premium assets both individually and collectively, we evaluate the correct investment level for each of those, the activity levels to make sure that each asset will deliver improved metrics year-over-year. And ultimately, that will be driving optimized returns and free cash flow generation at the corporate level, and that's what will continue to set up EOG to create shareholder value in the near and long term. Honestly, the growth ends up being a real output of our ability to invest and continue to lower the cost basis of the company and provide both near-term and future free cash flow generation.Douglas George Blyth LeggateAn interesting dilemma. Ezra, thank you for your perspective on that. A quick follow-up, hopefully, is a quick one. I wanted to touch on, I think this was asked earlier, but I wanted to elaborate just a little bit. The comments about inflation limiting to 10% this year, but it's too early to talk about 2024. You're the -- pretty much the second to last company to have your earnings call this quarter. And pretty much everybody else has been pointing to, yes, we're going to see some deflation in 2024. I'm just -- are you just being conservative, or do you genuinely believe that there's still upside risk to capital in '24 from inflation, I mean.Lloyd W. HelmsNo, Doug, I don't think we are anticipating that you'll see inflation into next year. I think what the comment was when we started out the year let me just clarify something. We saw inflation last year coming in the business. Rig counts kind of peaked in November of last year. We anticipated we would see a deflation in the market going into this year. And so we built our plan based on the fact that our well cost in 2023 would increase no more than 10% relative to 2022. So that's where the 10% comment comes from. As we go into '24, I think we recognize -- and clearly, we're seeing deflation in our business I'd say it's too early to predict what that level of deflation is going to do to our well cost next year. There's still a lot of market dynamics that we see in the business as Ezra just went through. And so it's early to predict what that impact that's going to have on next year's capital program as well as kind of how we choose to develop our plays across the different plays that we have to invest in. So that's the comment about too early for next year. It's just too early with the market dynamics we have for next year.OperatorNext question comes from Leo Mariani of ROTH Capital Partners.Leo Paul MarianiJust wanted to kind of touch base on some of the emerging plays, really thinking about kind of Utica and PRB. And also some of the undisclosed exploratory plays out there as well. Just trying to get a sense if generally speaking, you've seen any increased competition in these plays during the course of 2023. I mean it still seems like EOG being a bit of a lone wolf in pursuing some of these plays where others maybe aren't doing as much, but maybe there's more kind of going on behind the scenes that you guys can help out with here.Ezra Y. YacobYes, Leo, this is Ezra. Yes, we continue to see very limited competition domestically on any exploration, I think, and you can kind of see that to just in the public comments that are made. Most operators, companies, whether private or public, have really kind of picked the basin and are honing in on more of a drill down kind of specialist manufacturing mode. We continue to explore. And as Ken said, we're still looking to put on low-cost, high-quality bolt-on opportunities in some of those plays. With respect to the Utica and PRB in specific. It's a little bit early this year on Utica. We're pleased with what we're seeing on the operations side. And as Ken said, we'll get a completion spread in there and get some results here coming up. On the PRB, we've had a very strong year. Everything has really fallen in the line there. And again, the PRB and Dorado are really benefiting from more of a continuous operations program this year as we focus on Austin Chalk and a little bit of co-development in the Eagle Ford and Dorado, and then we center most of our focus in the PRB in the Southern PRB is basically on the Mowry this year. And then shifting to international for just a minute on the exploration side. As you guys know, we both explore onshore and offshore and shallow water internationally. I would say onshore, there's still limited competition on the exploration side for unconventionals in what we see. Of course, it's still a high bar that we have for international opportunities to -- they really do need to compete with our domestic portfolio. We're not just exploring internationally to try and say that we've got something internationally, it really needs to compete and deliver value for the shareholders. And then in the shallow water, probably a bit of the same, maybe a little bit more exploration out there. But dominantly, I think what you're hearing about in offshore international exploration is a bit more in the deep and even ultra-deepwater than really in the shallow water that we're focused on.Leo Paul MarianiOkay. Appreciate that. Just wanted to turn to CapEx for a minute here. You talked about this a little bit in your prepared comments, but you guys are kind of at 50% of the budget in the first half kind of right on where you expected here. Looking at guidance, third quarter CapEx is up a fair bit versus second quarter. So do we expect to see kind of a commensurate drop in 4Q capital to kind of get you back to that kind of midpoint on the full year? Just trying to get a sense of kind of CapEx cadence in the second half?Lloyd W. HelmsYes, Leo, this is Billy. So on the CapEx, I'd say our drilling and completion activity has been very ratable throughout the year, and we're pretty much on track with what our [plan had] laid out. The reason third quarter is up is simply due to the timing of our non-drilling and completion capital, and it moved from the second quarter into the second half of the year. Everything else, all of our drilling and completion CapEx is really on pace with what we laid out. We've spent about half the CapEx for the year, and we've completed about half the wells that we're planning for the year. So I'd say everything is pretty much on track. But fourth quarter will be a reflection of how that non-D&C non-drilling and completion CapEx gets spent in the third.OperatorNext question comes from Scott Gruber of Citigroup.Scott Andrew GruberI'll just go ahead and ask 2 questions up front here since they're related, you guys know to continue the efficiency gains in the emerging plays. What are you seeing in terms of efficiency gains more broadly across the portfolio? Obviously, the gains are always greatest in the new plays, but I'm curious if you're still seeing solid gains more broadly across the portfolio. And if you are, without adding rigs and frac crews next year, just curious how much the overall well count could potentially grow next year just on the back of those efficiency gains? Is that a kind of low single-digit type figure potentially a mid-single-digit figure?Lloyd W. HelmsYes, Scott, this is Billy. We're still seeing continued improvements, although as you noted, at a lesser pace than our more active foundational plays like the Delaware Basin and the Eagle Ford, simply because we've been active there for a long period of time. And as you noted, the emerging plays benefit from that transfer of technology more rapidly, I guess, than some of the existing plays. And really, I'd just like to tie that back in a little bit. We still experiment quite a bit with applying technology across all of our assets and especially true of our foundational plays, the efforts we've gone to, to put in our data systems and track data across our plays gives us a lot of insights on how to -- how things are performing. That goes back to our bringing in-house our drilling tools, our drilling motors, those kind of things. So we still see improvements in some of our supplemental deck in the back, you can see some of the increase in drilling times say, in our Permian program, and how that's improved over time, and we continue to drive that down. And so that's an effort there. And then the same for the Eagle Ford, I think those are some of the spots in the back of our deck. So we're still seeing improvements in both the drilling times and the completed lateral feet per day, and we're very encouraged with that because that enables the technology transfer enables quickly to go to the emerging plays and continue to reduce our cost. How that translates into next year. Again, I'd say we're still a little bit early to see how things are going to play out on the macro side, depending on what the market looks like. So it's early to see, but I'm encouraged with the efficiency gains that we're seeing that we'll continue to find sustainable ways to improve our business and lower our cost basis going forward.OperatorOur next question comes from Derrick Whitfield of Stifel.Derrick Lee WhitfieldFor my first question, I wanted to focus on long lateral development, which has been seen throughout Q2 and its development you're highlighting in the Eagle Ford with an over 15,000-foot lateral this quarter. As it relates to the Eagle Ford and perhaps more broadly for your portfolio, are there considerations beyond lease geometry and legacy development that would limit your ability to pursue more 15,000-foot laterals?Kenneth W. BoedekerYes, Derrick, this is Ken. Really, longer laterals are a way we're increasing our capital efficiency in the Eagle Ford. If you look at it, we've drilled over 85 wells with laterals over 2.5 miles long across the Eagle Ford. And we've utilized these longer laterals over the last 5-plus years, where appropriate. You think about it, the faulting across the Eagle Ford does make these longer laterals challenging, but our data-driven approach and multidisciplinary teams enable us to steer the laterals within some narrow target windows and apply an optimal completion design to maximize that capital efficiency. These longer laterals have really contributed to us lowering our cost basis in the Eagle Ford and are an example of how we're focused on increasing our efficiencies even in that play where we've been developing it for over 10 years.Lloyd W. HelmsYes, Derrick, this is Billy. I just might add, the lessons we're learning from our longer laterals, we're pushing in the Eagle Ford, we're applying across all of our portfolio. And so we're seeing those opportunities across every asset that we have.OperatorOur next question comes from Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs.Neil Singhvi MehtaThe first question is just around Dorado. Maybe you could talk about how that's tracking versus your target. How do you think about the timing of recompleting those Dorado wells?Kenneth W. BoedekerYes, Neil, this is Ken. As far as the way that's tracking, the 5 wells that we've deferred, we would see that we'd be completing those early in next year. And it's still early in the play and the wells in our core area are really performing as we've anticipated.Neil Singhvi MehtaTiming dynamic. And then would love your perspective stepping back to talk about the M&A market. We've seen a pickup in consolidation throughout U.S. shale. How do you think of EOG's role in future consolidation? And is the best strategy given the exploration program that we've been talking about here is to continue organically to grow the business? Or do you think there are going to be opportunities (inaudible) to bolt on?Ezra Y. YacobYes, Neil, this is Ezra. I think we've been 30 years strong as an organic exploration company, 20 years separated there. And I think that's -- the thing about that is the way we look at these deals is that it's similar to how I described every investment decision is, it's a returns-based decision, and how is that investment going to create long-term shareholder value. We don't think of M&A versus exploration. But as a first mover, looking -- trying to capture the sweet spots of new plays, obviously, you can get a lower cost of entry and that offers a higher return. So the exploration, I think, organic exploration stands on itself. With regards specifically to M&As, we're aware of opportunities. We evaluate many, many opportunities. And the challenge with it always comes back to, is that opportunity really going to be additive to the corporate portfolio? Is it really going to be something that we -- is better than what we're already drilling is it's something that's going to add to the returns and add to the 10 billion barrels of equivalents that we've already captured as premium resources. And we continue just to evaluate opportunities, but kind of come up short with that evaluation.OperatorOur next question comes from Roger Read of Wells Fargo.Roger David ReadI'd like to come back to 2 things that have been discussed a little bit. One, Ezra, just you talked about the low carbon advantage or the emissions advantage of Dorado. I was wondering if you could go in a little more depth on specifically what you see there? And then my other question will be on the inflation side. With oil at $80, $85 right now, aren't we sitting in a situation where inflation pressures might be reversing rather than behind us? And if that's not the right way to look at it, I'd be curious what you are seeing that says deflation is the right track here.Kenneth W. BoedekerYes, Roger, this is Ken. I'll go ahead and answer the first part of that with Dorado. We're really confident that our gas production at Dorado generates significant returns and that development will be both operationally efficient and have a small emissions footprint because of the dry nature of the gas and really the proximity of that gas to the Gulf Coast markets.Lloyd W. HelmsYes, Roger, this is Billy. On the inflation question, I think you're spot on. I think that's why we're saying, certainly, we see deflation in the market today, but it's too early to think about 2024 because of the dynamic markets that we're seeing play out. And we're kind of be patient and watch the market and see how it develops before we make any comments about where cost would go in 2024. I think as a company, we're certainly well positioned to take advantage of any opportunities that are presented in our strategy about contracting and seeking out the highest-performing crews are things that drive really our focus on sustainable cost improvements through the long term, and that's really what drives our advantage over trying to capture the premium barrel, premium price for all of our products.OperatorWe have no further questions on the phone line. So I'll hand back to Mr. Yacob.Ezra Y. YacobWe appreciate everyone's time today on the phone call. Thank you to our shareholders for their support, and I just want to give a special thanks to our employees for delivering another exceptional quarter. Thank you, everybody.OperatorThank you for joining. This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect your lines."
2023-08-06,"The main point of investing for the long term is to make money. Furthermore, you'd generally like to see the share price rise faster than the market. But Assurant, Inc. (NYSE:AIZ) has fallen short of that second goal, with a share price rise of 33% over five years, which is below the market return. Zooming in, the stock is actually down 8.7% in the last year.After a strong gain in the past week, it's worth seeing if longer term returns have been driven by improving fundamentals. See our latest analysis for Assurant To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Assurant's earnings per share are down 3.4% per year, despite strong share price performance over five years.So it's hard to argue that the earnings per share are the best metric to judge the company, as it may not be optimized for profits at this point. Since the change in EPS doesn't seem to correlate with the change in share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics.We doubt the modest 2.0% dividend yield is attracting many buyers to the stock. On the other hand, Assurant's revenue is growing nicely, at a compound rate of 5.5% over the last five years. It's quite possible that management are prioritizing revenue growth over EPS growth at the moment.The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-and-revenue-growthIf you are thinking of buying or selling Assurant stock, you should check out this FREE detailed report on its balance sheet.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Assurant, it has a TSR of 47% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveInvestors in Assurant had a tough year, with a total loss of 6.8% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 8.2%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 8%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

It's calculated based on three factors: historical multiples at which the stock has traded, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past performance and growth, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line represents the fair value at which the stock should ideally be traded. If the stock price significantly deviates from the GF Value Line, it may indicate overvaluation or undervaluation, impacting its future returns.Based on the GF Value calculation, Sealed Air (NYSE:SEE) seems to be modestly undervalued. With a current price of $40.6 per share and a market cap of $5.9 billion, it's believed that the stock's long-term return is likely to be higher than its business growth due to its relative undervaluation.Sealed Air Corp (SEE): An Undervalued Gem in the Packaging Industry?Link: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Sealed Air's Financial StrengthInvesting in companies with poor financial strength carries a higher risk of permanent capital loss. Therefore, it's essential to review a company's financial strength before buying its stock. Sealed Air's cash-to-debt ratio of 0.06 is worse than 84.95% of companies in the Packaging & Containers industry, indicating poor financial strength. The company's overall financial strength is ranked 4 out of 10 by GuruFocus.Story continuesSealed Air Corp (SEE): An Undervalued Gem in the Packaging Industry?Profitability and Growth of Sealed AirInvesting in profitable companies typically carries less risk. Sealed Air has been profitable for 10 out of the past 10 years, demonstrating consistent profitability. Over the past 12 months, the company had revenues of $5.6 billion and an EPS of $2.77. Its operating margin of 15.36% is better than 91.53% of companies in the Packaging & Containers industry, indicating strong profitability.One of the most critical factors in company valuation is growth. The average annual revenue growth of Sealed Air is 7.4%, which ranks better than 54.26% of companies in the Packaging & Containers industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth is 17.4%, which ranks better than 74.1% of companies in the same industry.ROIC vs WACCA comparison of a company's return on invested capital (ROIC) to the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) can provide insights into its profitability. Sealed Air's ROIC is 11.08, and its WACC is 8.08. When the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it implies the company is creating value for shareholders.Sealed Air Corp (SEE): An Undervalued Gem in the Packaging Industry?ConclusionIn summary, Sealed Air stock appears to be modestly undervalued. Despite the company's poor financial condition, its profitability is strong, and its growth ranks better than 74.1% of companies in the Packaging & Containers industry.

Based on my initial review, I believe that the Viactiv business has the potential to grow by focusing on powerful brand messaging with science-based claims that rank highest for shoppers’ purchase intent. We believe that we can deliver this messaging with an emotional hook that connects with the values, needs and aspirations of our target consumers. We recently implemented a Bold Age advertising campaign for the Viactiv calcium chews that has already seen positive results, as compared with industry metrics and prior Viactiv campaigns. As we learn more from in-market performance, we will continue to refine and optimize the creative aspects of our marketing campaigns. Effective advertising, combined with targeted marketing initiatives, product innovations in existing and new product segments, plus expanded retail and online distribution, will be the engine of future growth to make Viactiv a broad-based destination health and wellness brand with a foundation in clinically supported efficacy.”“We have seen the initial results of management’s continuing efforts to improve operating performance during the first half of 2023, reflected in improved operating margins in the second quarter of 2023 and a reduced cash burn. The focus on efficiency will be ongoing in the second half of the year.”“We continue to believe that the Company remains undervalued in the public market, specifically with regard to the clinical nutrition platform and the brand that we are building. Our work with Alantra, LLC (“Alantra”), our exclusive financial advisor, is underway as we conduct our strategic review to solicit and evaluate alternatives to maximize stockholder value in the near-term, which could range from a sale of the Company, sale of the Viactiv brand, merger, asset acquisition, reverse acquisition, or other potential strategic transaction. As this process evolves, we anticipate providing updates to our stockholders as developments warrant.”“In the meantime, we believe our market position and the extendability of the Viactiv brand, combined with our current operating business strategy, provide us with a viable platform from which to leverage our resources to continue our efforts to grow operations, improve financial performance and maximize stockholder value,” concluded Ms. Hall.Financial Results Additional information with respect to the Company’s business, operations and financial condition as of and for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2023 is contained in the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2023, which has been filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) at www.sec.gov.About Guardion Health Sciences, Inc.Guardion Health Sciences, Inc.

It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Tony McDonald, Chairman and CEO of CEA Industries. Sir, the floor is yours.Tony McDonald: Thank you and good afternoon everyone. The volatility in the broader cannabis environment has continued as operators contend with the prolonged effects of pricing and inflationary pressures. We have also witnessed a reduction in investment in and reorganization within the controlled environment agricultural sector. As a result, capital expenditures across both sectors remain reduced, resulting in delayed, reduced or eliminated construction projects. These conditions have had an adverse impact on our net bookings and revenue over the last year. As a result of the challenges this year, we preemptively implemented a series of cost cutting initiatives that have reduced our operating expenses by more than 60% compared to the year ago period.Story continuesWe have taken a disciplined approach to capital allocation with respect to product development, marketing, and personnel. We plan to identify additional savings opportunities in the months ahead as we remain intently focused on maintaining this lean cost structure without compromising the high level of service our customers expect. Despite dialing back our marketing spend, we are well equipped to continue sourcing and evaluating new opportunities as well as servicing our current contracts as we further diversify our customer base across the cannabis and traditional agricultural sectors. As we announced alongside our Q2 results earlier today, we have initiated a review of strategic alternatives, including a sale, merger, or other potential strategic or financial transaction to protect and maximize shareholder value.Our Board of Directors has retained Roth Capital Partners as our financial advisor to assist in the review process. We are committed to executing on the best path forward for our shareholders, customers, and employees. We will not be commenting further on this until the Board has concluded that disclosure is appropriate or required. Looking ahead, we’ll be mindful of the challenging environment as we seek additional cost savings and secure new contract wins in the cannabis and traditional agriculture verticals. We have taken the necessary measures to navigate these uncertain times, and we believe these initiatives coupled with our strong balance sheet will enable us to continue servicing our customers while we seek to maximize shareholder value.I will now hand it over to Ian Patel, our Chief Financial Officer, to discuss financial highlights for the quarter before wrapping up with closing remarks. Ian?5 Best Medical Specialties for Female Doctors and MomsCopyright: stokkete / 123RF Stock PhotoIan Patel: Thanks Tony, and good afternoon everyone. Jumping right into our results. Q2 revenue was $1.1 million compared to $3 million in a year ago period. The decrease was primarily attributed to lower revenue recognition from our backlog and an overall reduction in capital expenditures by cannabis and controlled agricultural operators. Net bookings in the second quarter were approximately $200,000 compared to $1.5 million in the same period in 2022. Our quarter end backlog was $1.1 million compared to $9.7 million in the year ago quarter. The decrease in net bookings and backlog was again primarily driven by fewer capital projects and expenditures in the industry. Gross profit for the second quarter of 2023 was approximately $79,000 or 7.4% of revenue compared to $300,000 or 10.2% of revenue for the same period in 2022.The decrease in gross margin was primarily driven by an increase in fixed costs as a percentage of revenue, which includes the cost of services, engineering, manufacturing, and project management. Operating expenses in the second quarter decreased 62% to approximately $800,000, compared to $2.1 million the year ago quarter. The decrease was primarily driven by lower product development expenses, reduced personnel and marketing costs as well as a $632,000 goodwill impairment that occurred in the year ago period. It’s worth noting that our OpEx decreased 38% from Q1 of 2023, reflecting a continued benefit from the cost saving initiatives implemented over the past few months. Net loss for the second quarter of 2023 improved to approximately $700,000 or negative $0.09 per share compared to a net loss of $1.8 million or negative $0.23 per share in the year ago quarter.As of June 30, 2023, cash and cash equivalents were $14.2 million compared to $18.6 million as of December 31, 2022, while working capital decreased by approximately $900,000 during this period. At June 30, 2023, we remain debt free. This concludes my prepared remarks. I will pass it back to you, Tony.Tony McDonald: Thank you, Ian. As we look to the back half of the year, we will continue to run the lean operation while targeting new contract wins in both the cannabis and traditional agriculture verticals, between our robust balance sheet, optimized cost structure, and prudent approach to capital allocation, we are well-positioned to navigate this challenging environment and deliver value to our customers and shareholders alike.

2023-08-17,"Biotech stocks aren’t for everyone. But if you want to dive into a sector that can potentially give you incredible returns, you’ll want to focus your search on A-rated biotech stocks.Biotech companies are involved in the study of organisms, cells and biological systems to develop products, applications and treatments.These companies are deep into research and development and could spend millions to research products in hopes of a scientific breakthrough and regulatory approvals.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut it’s not easy. If you invest in biotech stocks, you have to be comfortable with the idea that your company could live or die with the success or failure of a single drug or product.That means that the industry is affected not only by the results of clinical trials but also by regulatory decisions, which could take months.But if your company hits, the results can be life-changing for investors and patients who benefit from the new treatment or product.I’ve used the Portfolio Grader to identify some top-rated biotech stocks that are worth a look at today. If you are eager to enter the sector, this is an excellent place to start.ANI Pharmaceuticals (ANIP)Hands with puppet string and a red and green candlestick stock chart.Source: ShutterstockLocated in Minnesota, ANI Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ANIP) develops, manufactures and markets branded and generic prescription medications. It has dozens of successful products on the market.Currently, the company is focusing on building a purified franchise cortrophin gel, a medication injected under the skin or muscle to treat autoimmune and inflammatory conditions.It’s also working on expanding and strengthening its generic medications business.So far, business is going well. Second-quarter earnings were $116.55 million in revenue and earnings per share of $1.28, beating analysts’ estimates of $99.86 million in revenue and EPS of 67 cents.ANIP stock is up 50% this year and has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Story continuesImmunoGen (IMGN)Biotechnology stocks, biomedical stocksSource: aslysun / Shutterstock.comImmunoGen (NASDAQ:IMGN) is a biotech company developing antibody-drug conjugate technology to combat cancer. ADCs are cancer-killing toxins attached via a biodegradable linker to a specific antibody.ImmunoGen works on finding the correct combination of cancer targets, antibodies, payloads and linkers to develop effective ADCs that a cancer patient can tolerate.It currently has an ovarian cancer drug, Elahere, to market, and several other drugs in various stages of development. One of those tests also involves Elahere, which got positive results in May as a second potential treatment for cancer.Earnings for the second quarter were sales of $83.15 million, which beat analysts’ estimates of $46.6 million. But the company’s still losing money, as its EPS was a loss of 2 cents per share.But investors aren’t concerned, and you shouldn’t be either. IMGN stock is up 180% this year and has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Wave Life Sciences (WVE)half of a double helix molecule of DNASource: ShutterstockWave Life Sciences (NASDAQ:WVE) is a clinical-stage RNA medicine company developing treatments for conditions such as muscular dystrophy and Huntington’s disease.RNA therapeutics involve using ribonucleic acid molecules as agents to treat diseases, either through messenger RNA (mRNA), small interfering RNA (siRNA) or microRNA (miRNA).RNA drugs are interesting from an investor’s perspective because the treatments can be developed and produced quickly, as it was for the development of Covid-19 vaccines.Wave Life Sciences currently has two drugs in clinical Phase 1 or 2 testing and says it’s “on the cusp” of moving the industry’s first RNA editing therapeutic candidate to clinical testing.Considering the company’s deep into the testing and development phase and doesn’t have products to bring to market yet, the stock is volatile. But the company is building momentum and was added to the Russell 2000 and Russell 3000 indices in June.WVE stock has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Enliven Therapeutics (ELVN)Photo of test tubes and droplet with purple and reddish-orange sunset visual effect, representing biotechSource: shutterstock.com/Romix ImageEnliven Therapeutics (NASDAQ:ELVN) is a biotech company in Boulder, Colorado, working on cancer treatments.Its research involves developing kinase inhibitors to block overactive proteins that trigger abnormal cell behavior and growth.Its most advanced candidate is in Phase 1 clinical trials. ELVN-001 is a potential treatment for patients who have chronic myeloid leukemia. It’s also testing a drug to potentially treat non-small cell lung cancer.ELVN stock jumped earlier this year when it completed a savvy move – it closed a merger with Boston rare disease specialist Imara after that company had two Phase 2B trials fail. By buying the distressed stock and raising $165 million from institutional investors to fund research, Enliven acquired some assets on the cheap.ELVN stock is up 328% this year and has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Nuvalent (NUVL)DNA strand and Cancer Cell Oncology Research Concept 3D rendering.

The company develops small molecules to overcome resistance, minimize adverse events, address brain metastases, and drive more durable patient responses.It has two drug candidates in clinical trials to treat non-small cell lung cancer and other solid tumors. With $431 million in financing in hand, the company says it has a cash runway into the second half of 2025. The company reported a net loss of $29.1 million in the second quarter, with nearly $26 million coming from research and development expenses.However, investors are bullish on the stock. The price nearly reached $50 per share earlier this summer, and even after a modest pullback is up 46% this year.NULV stock has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Eli Lilly and Company (LLY)Eli Lilly (LLY) sign on corporate building with blue sky in backgroundSource: shutterstock.com/Michael ViEli Lilly and Company (NASDAQ:LLY) is a major pharmaceutical company in Indianapolis. The drugmaker has high hopes for two drugs that could bring windfalls to investors.First, there’s donanemab, a treatment for Alzheimer’s disease that could get approval from the Food and Drug Administration in the next year. Then there’s tirzepatide, sold under the brand name Mounjaro to treat type 2 diabetes. Lilly is asking the FDA to approve the drug as a treatment for obesity. If approved, the change could mean $25 billion in annual revenues.Lilly is also on a growth spurt. It recently announced plans to buy Versanis Bio, which is developing treatments for cardiometabolic diseases, for $1.925 billion. And it just closed its acquisition of Dice Therapeutics, which expands Lilly’s immunology portfolio.LLY stock is up 44% this year and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Novo Nordisk (NVO)Novo Nordisk logo on a corporate buildingSource: joreks / Shutterstock.comNovo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) is a Danish pharmaceutical company that focuses on developing treatments for diabetes.Diabetes affects an estimated 537 million adults around the world, and that number is expected to rise to 643 million by 2030.But a significant catalyst for Novo Nordisk is interest in its weight loss drug, Wegovy. The drug is so popular that doctors often report shortages and then prescribe another Novo Nordisk drug, Ozempic, as an alternative.Wegovy is already available in the U.S. and Denmark, but Novo Nordisk is now introducing it in Germany, making it the first launch of the drug into a large European market. Investors should be excited about the potential of other European Union countries opening their doors to Wegovy.NVO stock is up 35% this year and has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.On the date of publication, Louis Navellier had long positions in NVO.

(Nasdaq: CNET) (the ""Company""), an integrated online advertising, precision marketing, data analytics and other value-added services provider serving enterprise clients, today announced its unaudited financial results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023.Second Quarter 2023 Financial ResultsRevenuesFor the second quarter of 2023, revenues increased by approximately $2.88 million, or 41.4%, to $9.82 million from $6.95 million for the same period last year. The increase in revenues was primarily attributable to the increase in our main stream service revenues, i.e. distribution of the right to use search engine marketing services as a result of the end of the peak infection wave of COVID-19 in the first fiscal quarter of 2023 where business activities and performance are gradually getting back to normal in the second fiscal quarter; and a portion of our clients’ ad consumption shifts from using our ad portal placement services to using our search engine marketing service.Cost of revenuesTotal cost of revenues increased by approximately $2.91 million, or 41.3%, to $9.93 million for the second quarter of 2023 from $7.03 million for the same period last year.

2023-08-22,"EzFill Holdings Inc.-- Revenue Increased 63% year over year to $6.1 Million From $3.8 Million ---- Approx. 1.6 Million Gallons Delivered, Up 102% From Prior Year –-- 20 New Fleet Customers Added in Quarter ---- Net Loss Narrows by $1.4 Million or $0.47 per share --MIAMI, FL, Aug. 22, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- EzFill Holdings, Inc. (“EzFill” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: EZFL), a pioneer and emerging leader in the mobile fueling industry, announced today its financial results for the three-month period ended June 30, 2023 (“2Q23” or “second quarter 2023”).Q2 23 Highlights (in USD, except gallons delivered)  Q2 2023Q2 2022Financial Highlights  Revenue6,130,661 3,754,431 Net loss(2,468,811)(3,872,670)Adjusted EBITDA*(1,545,807)(3,005,630)Operating Highlights  Total Gallons Delivered1,583,320 782,0367    * See end of this press release for reconciliation to US GAAPCommenting on the second quarter results, Interim CEO Yehuda Levy stated, “Our second quarter financial results reflect improvement in both the comparison to the prior year second quarter, and sequentially from the first quarter of 2023. Of particular note is that we increased our gallons delivered to another record in the second quarter of 2023, which was 102% higher year over year and we increased our margins by $0.13 per gallon. We continue to grow our fleet business, adding 20 new fleet customers in the second quarter of 2023, bringing our total to 54 new fleet customers for the year.“We continue to work on reducing our overall expenses and improving our operations. The team has helped achieve another quarterly record for both gallons delivered and revenues. We hope to continue our momentum in the coming months.”Second Quarter 2023 Financial ResultsDuring the second quarter of 2023, the Company reported revenue of $6.1million, up from $3.8 million in the prior year period, a 63% increase, primarily due to a 102% increase in gallons delivered. Total gallons delivered in the second quarter of 2023 were 1,583,320 compared to 782,037 in the prior year period, reflecting new customers in existing and new markets, as well as expansion of certain existing customers to new markets. Average fuel margin per gallon was $0.60 for the quarter an increase of $0.13 per gallon from the previous quarter.Story continuesCost of sales was $5.6 million for the second quarter of 2023 compared to $3.8 million for the prior year period. The increase from the prior year reflects the increase in sales as well as the hiring of additional drivers, primarily in new markets and the cost of fuel.Operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, were $2.4 million for the second quarter of 2023, compared to $3.4 million in the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in payroll, technology expenses, stock compensation and public company expenses as we continue to achieve efficiencies in our operations.Depreciation and amortization decreased to $0.28 million in the second quarter of 2023 from $0.46 million in the prior year period due to the write-off of intangibles in 2022.Interest expense increased in the current year due to increased borrowing for truck purchases during 2022.The net loss in the second quarter of 2023 was $(2.5) million, compared to $(3.9) million in the prior year period. Loss per share improved in the quarter to $(0.71) from $(1.18) in the prior year period.Adjusted EBITDA loss in the second quarter of 2023 was $(1.5) million as compared to Adjusted EBITDA loss of $(3.0) million in the second quarter of 2022. The improvement in adjusted EBITDA reflects both the improved margin and the operating cost efficiencies.As previously reported, on April 26, 2023, the Company effected a 1:8 reverse stock split of its common stock. All share related amounts have been adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split.Balance SheetAt June 30, 2023, the Company had a cash position of $1.4 million, compared with $4.2 million at year end 2022. The Company had long-term debt of $1.1 million and had outstanding borrowings under its line of credit of $1.0 million as of quarter end. Currently the Company has limited cash and is relying on related party loans to fund its business operations.About EzFillWith the number of gas stations in the U.S. continuing to decline, corporate giants such as Shell, Exxon, GM, Bridgestone, Enterprise, and Mitsubishi have recognized the increasing shift in consumer behavior and are investing in the fast growing on-demand mobile fueling industry.

When used in this press release, the words “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “future,” “intend,” “plan,” or the negative of these terms and similar expressions, as they relate to us or our management, identify forward-looking statements. Such statements, include, but are not limited to, statements contained in this press release relating to our business strategy, our future operating results and liquidity and capital resources outlook. Forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward–looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Our actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. They are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees of assurance of future performance. We caution you therefore against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include, without limitation, our ability to raise capital to fund continuing operations; our ability to protect our intellectual property rights; the impact of any infringement actions or other litigation brought against us; competition from other providers and products; our ability to develop and commercialize products and services; changes in government regulation; our ability to complete capital raising transactions; and other factors relating to our industry, our operations and results of operations.

Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure which we use in our financial performance analyses. This measure should not be considered a substitute for GAAP-basis measures, nor should it be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with GAAP. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the impact of net interest expense, taxes, depreciation, amortization and stock compensation expense, provides useful supplemental information that is essential to a proper understanding of our financial results. Non-GAAP measures are not formally defined by GAAP, and other entities may use calculation methods that differ from ours for the purposes of calculating Adjusted EBITDA. As a complement to GAAP financial measures, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA assists investors who follow the practice of some investment analysts who adjust GAAP financial measures to exclude items that may obscure underlying performance and distort comparability.The following is a reconciliation of net loss to the non-GAAP financial measure referred to as Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022  Three Months EndedJune 30,   2023  2022 Net loss $(2,468,811) $(3,872,670)Interest expense  306,547   6,167 Depreciation and amortization  277,608   458,811 Stock compensation  338,849   402,061 Adjusted EBITDA $(1,545,807) $(3,005,630)  For the Three Months Ended June 30,   2023  2022        Sales – net $6,130,661  $3,754,431          Costs and Expenses        Cost of sales  5,646,291   3,755,861 General and administrative expenses  2,369,026   3,406,262 Depreciation and amortization  277,608   458,811 Total Costs and Expenses  8,292,925   7,620,934          Loss from operations  (2,162,264)  (3,866,503)         Other income (expense)        Interest income  14,461   19,754 Interest expense  (308,189)  (25,921)Loss on sale of marketable debt securities  (12,819)  - Total other income (expense) – net  (306,547)  (6,167)         Net loss $(2,468,811) $(3,872,670)         Loss per share - basic and diluted $(0.71) $(1.18)         Weighted average number of shares - basic and diluted  3,469,490   3,294,252          Comprehensive loss:        Net loss $(2,468,811) $(3,872,670)Change in fair value of debt securities  -   (17,208)Total comprehensive loss: $(2,468,811) $(3,889,878)EzFill Holdings, Inc. and SubsidiaryConsolidated Balance Sheets  June 30, 2023  December 31, 2022   (Unaudited)  (Audited)        Assets          Current Assets        Cash $1,359,333  $2,066,793 Investment in debt securities  -   2,120,082 Accounts receivable – net  1,004,114   766,692 Inventory  130,341   151,248 Prepaids and other  263,556   329,351 Total Current Assets  2,757,344   5,434,166          Property and equipment – net  3,994,302   4,589,159          Operating lease - right-of-use asset  411,025   521,782          Deposits  53,017   52,737          Total Assets $7,215,688  $10,597,844          Liabilities and Stockholders’ Equity          Current Liabilities        Accounts payable and accrued expenses $974,313  $1,256,479 Line of credit  1,000,000   1,000,000 Notes payable – net  767,339   811,516 Notes payable – related party  1,171,800   - Operating lease liability  238,042   230,014 Total Current Liabilities  4,151,494   3,298,009          Long Term Liabilities        Notes payable  1,062,827   1,198,380 Operating lease liability  202,002   316,008 Total Long Term Liabilities  1,264,829   1,514,388          Total Liabilities  5,416,323   4,812,397          Commitments and Contingencies                 Stockholders’ Equity        Preferred stock - $0.0001 par value; 5,000,000 shares authorized none issued and outstanding, respectively  -   - Common stock - $0.0001 par value, 50,000,000 shares authorized 3,791,332 shares issued and 3,641,332 shares outstanding at June 30, 2023 and 3,335,674 shares issued and outstanding at December 31, 2022  379   334 Additional paid-in capital  41,461,729   40,674,864 Accumulated deficit  (39,662,743)  (34,845,161)Accumulated other comprehensive loss  -   (44,590)Total Redeemable Common Stock and Stockholders’ Equity  1,799,365   5,785,447          Total Liabilities and Stockholders’ Equity $7,215,688  $10,597,844 "

2023-08-25,"The Gabelli Convertible & Income Securities Fund Inc.RYE, N.Y., Aug. 25, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Board of Directors of The Gabelli Convertible and Income Securities Fund Inc. (NYSE:GCV) (the “Fund”) declared a $0.12 per share cash distribution payable on September 22, 2023 to common stock shareholders of record on September 15, 2023.The Fund intends to pay a minimum annual distribution of 8% of the average net asset value of the Fund within a calendar year or an amount sufficient to satisfy the minimum distribution requirements of the Internal Revenue Code for regulated investment companies. The average net asset value of the Fund is based on the average net asset values as of the last day of the four preceding calendar quarters during the year. The net asset value per share fluctuates daily.Each quarter, the Board of Directors reviews the amount of any potential distribution from the income, realized capital gain, or capital available. The Board of Directors will continue to monitor the Fund’s distribution level, taking into consideration the Fund’s net asset value and the current financial market environment. The Fund’s distribution policy is subject to modification by the Board of Directors at any time, and there can be no guarantee that the policy will continue. The distribution rate should not be considered the dividend yield or total return on an investment in the Fund.All or part of the distribution may be treated as long-term capital gain or qualified dividend income (or a combination of both) for individuals, each subject to the maximum federal income tax rate for long term capital gains, which is currently 20% in taxable accounts for individuals (or less depending on an individual’s tax bracket). In addition, certain U.S. shareholders who are individuals, estates or trusts and whose income exceeds certain thresholds will be required to pay a 3.8% Medicare surcharge on their “net investment income”, which includes dividends received from the Fund and capital gains from the sale or other disposition of shares of the Fund.Story continuesIf the Fund does not generate sufficient earnings (dividends and interest income, less expenses, and realized net capital gain) equal to or in excess of the aggregate distributions paid by the Fund in a given year, then the amount distributed in excess of the Fund’s earnings would be deemed a return of capital. Since this would be considered a return of a portion of a shareholder’s original investment, it is generally not taxable and would be treated as a reduction in the shareholder’s cost basis.Long-term capital gains, qualified dividend income, investment company taxable income, and return of capital, if any, will be allocated on a pro-rata basis to all distributions to common shareholders for the year. Based on the accounting records of the Fund currently available, each of the distributions paid to common shareholders in 2023 would include approximately 16% from net investment income, 10% from net capital gains and 74% would be deemed a return of capital on a book basis. This does not represent information for tax reporting purposes. The estimated components of each distribution are updated and provided to shareholders of record in a notice accompanying the distribution and are available on our website (www.gabelli.com). The final determination of the sources of all distributions in 2023 will be made after year end and can vary from the quarterly estimates. Shareholders should not draw any conclusions about the Fund’s investment performance from the amount of the current distribution. All individual shareholders with taxable accounts will receive written notification regarding the components and tax treatment for all 2023 distributions in early 2024 via Form 1099-DIV.Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the Fund before investing.

2023-08-29,"Exicure, Inc. (NASDAQ:XCUR) shares have had a horrible month, losing 25% after a relatively good period beforehand. The recent drop completes a disastrous twelve months for shareholders, who are sitting on a 55% loss during that time.After such a large drop in price, Exicure may be sending very bullish signals at the moment with its price-to-sales (or ""P/S"") ratio of 0.3x, since almost half of all companies in the Biotechs industry in the United States have P/S ratios greater than 11.8x and even P/S higher than 53x are not unusual. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly reduced P/S. Check out our latest analysis for Exicure ps-multiple-vs-industryWhat Does Exicure's Recent Performance Look Like?With revenue growth that's exceedingly strong of late, Exicure has been doing very well. One possibility is that the P/S ratio is low because investors think this strong revenue growth might actually underperform the broader industry in the near future. If that doesn't eventuate, then existing shareholders have reason to be quite optimistic about the future direction of the share price.Although there are no analyst estimates available for Exicure, take a look at this free data-rich visualisation to see how the company stacks up on earnings, revenue and cash flow.Is There Any Revenue Growth Forecasted For Exicure?In order to justify its P/S ratio, Exicure would need to produce anemic growth that's substantially trailing the industry.Retrospectively, the last year delivered an explosive gain to the company's top line. Pleasingly, revenue has also lifted 60% in aggregate from three years ago, thanks to the last 12 months of explosive growth. Accordingly, shareholders would have definitely welcomed those medium-term rates of revenue growth.Comparing that to the industry, which is predicted to deliver 118% growth in the next 12 months, the company's momentum is weaker, based on recent medium-term annualised revenue results.Story continuesWith this in consideration, it's easy to understand why Exicure's P/S falls short of the mark set by its industry peers. It seems most investors are expecting to see the recent limited growth rates continue into the future and are only willing to pay a reduced amount for the stock.What We Can Learn From Exicure's P/S?Exicure's P/S looks about as weak as its stock price lately. Generally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-sales ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company.In line with expectations, Exicure maintains its low P/S on the weakness of its recent three-year growth being lower than the wider industry forecast. Right now shareholders are accepting the low P/S as they concede future revenue probably won't provide any pleasant surprises. If recent medium-term revenue trends continue, it's hard to see the share price experience a reversal of fortunes anytime soon.We don't want to rain on the parade too much, but we did also find 3 warning signs for Exicure (2 shouldn't be ignored!) that you need to be mindful of.If these risks are making you reconsider your opinion on Exicure, explore our interactive list of high quality stocks to get an idea of what else is out there.Have feedback on this article?

2023-08-30,"For many, the main point of investing is to generate higher returns than the overall market. But every investor is virtually certain to have both over-performing and under-performing stocks. At this point some shareholders may be questioning their investment in Citizens Holding Company (NASDAQ:CIZN), since the last five years saw the share price fall 56%. We also note that the stock has performed poorly over the last year, with the share price down 40%. Furthermore, it's down 16% in about a quarter. That's not much fun for holders. This could be related to the recent financial results - you can catch up on the most recent data by reading our company report.So let's have a look and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. View our latest analysis for Citizens Holding To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).While the share price declined over five years, Citizens Holding actually managed to increase EPS by an average of 7.4% per year. So it doesn't seem like EPS is a great guide to understanding how the market is valuing the stock. Or possibly, the market was previously very optimistic, so the stock has disappointed, despite improving EPS.Due to the lack of correlation between the EPS growth and the falling share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics to try to understand the share price movement.The steady dividend doesn't really explain why the share price is down. While it's not completely obvious why the share price is down, a closer look at the company's history might help explain it.You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthIt's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Citizens Holding's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Citizens Holding the TSR over the last 5 years was -44%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveCitizens Holding shareholders are down 36% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 12%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 8% per year over five years. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should ""buy when there is blood on the streets"", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Citizens Holding better, we need to consider many other factors. Case in point: We've spotted   2 warning signs for Citizens Holding  you should be aware of.Citizens Holding is not the only stock that insiders are buying. For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

2023-09-02,"Regular readers will know that we love our dividends at Simply Wall St, which is why it's exciting to see Village Bank and Trust Financial Corp. (NASDAQ:VBFC) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next four days. The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Thus, you can purchase Village Bank and Trust Financial's shares before the 7th of September in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 15th of September.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.16 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$0.64 per share. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Village Bank and Trust Financial has a trailing yield of approximately 1.4% on its current stock price of $45. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Village Bank and Trust Financial's dividend is reliable and sustainable. So we need to investigate whether Village Bank and Trust Financial can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow. See our latest analysis for Village Bank and Trust Financial If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Village Bank and Trust Financial has a low and conservative payout ratio of just 13% of its income after tax.Companies that pay out less in dividends than they earn in profits generally have more sustainable dividends. The lower the payout ratio, the more wiggle room the business has before it could be forced to cut the dividend.Click here to see how much of its profit Village Bank and Trust Financial paid out over the last 12 months.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. That's why it's comforting to see Village Bank and Trust Financial's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 30% per annum for the past five years.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. In the past two years, Village Bank and Trust Financial has increased its dividend at approximately 6.9% a year on average. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders.Final TakeawayHas Village Bank and Trust Financial got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? Companies like Village Bank and Trust Financial that are growing rapidly and paying out a low fraction of earnings, are usually reinvesting heavily in their business. This strategy can add significant value to shareholders over the long term - as long as it's done without issuing too many new shares. Overall, Village Bank and Trust Financial looks like a promising dividend stock in this analysis, and we think it would be worth investigating further.With that in mind, a critical part of thorough stock research is being aware of any risks that stock currently faces. Case in point: We've spotted 1 warning sign for Village Bank and Trust Financial you should be aware of.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see. Here's a curated list of interesting stocks that are strong dividend payers.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

2023-09-04,"While not a mind-blowing move, it is good to see that the Odyssey Marine Exploration, Inc. (NASDAQ:OMEX) share price has gained 16% in the last three months. But don't envy holders -- looking back over 5 years the returns have been really bad. Indeed, the share price is down 53% in the period. So we're not so sure if the recent bounce should be celebrated. However, in the best case scenario (far from fait accompli), this improved performance might be sustained.So let's have a look and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. View our latest analysis for Odyssey Marine Exploration We don't think that Odyssey Marine Exploration's modest trailing twelve month profit has the market's full attention at the moment. We think revenue is probably a better guide. As a general rule, we think this kind of company is more comparable to loss-making stocks, since the actual profit is so low. It would be hard to believe in a more profitable future without growing revenues.Over half a decade Odyssey Marine Exploration reduced its trailing twelve month revenue by 23% for each year. That puts it in an unattractive cohort, to put it mildly. Arguably, the market has responded appropriately to this business performance by sending the share price down 9% (annualized) in the same time period. We don't generally like to own companies that lose money and don't grow revenues. You might be better off spending your money on a leisure activity. You'd want to research this company pretty thoroughly before buying, it looks a bit too risky for us.You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-and-revenue-growthIt is of course excellent to see how Odyssey Marine Exploration has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. This free interactive report on Odyssey Marine Exploration's balance sheet strength is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Odyssey Marine Exploration shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 24% over the last year. Notably the five-year annualised TSR loss of 9% per year compares very unfavourably with the recent share price performance. This makes us a little wary, but the business might have turned around its fortunes. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For instance, we've identified   6 warning signs for Odyssey Marine Exploration (2 are potentially serious)  that you should be aware of.But note: Odyssey Marine Exploration may not be the best stock to buy.

Adjusted EBITDA is not presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA represents net income (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and also excludes stock-based compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDA is presented because we believe it provides additional useful information to investors due to the various non-cash items during the period. Adjusted EBITDA is not recognized in accordance with GAAP, is unaudited, and has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as substitutes for analysis of the Company’s results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures, or contractual commitments; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on debt or cash income tax payments; although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and other companies in this industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than the Company does, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. The Company’s presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the section titled “Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) attributable to Golden Matrix Group, Inc., to Adjusted Earnings excluding Interest Expense, Interest Income, Amortization Expense and Stock-based Compensation Expense” included at the end of this release.Forward-Looking StatementsCertain statements made in this press release contain forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable securities laws, including within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (“forward-looking statements”).

Fiscal 2024 is off to a solid start with first quarter consolidated total revenue increasing almost 4% and adjusted EBITDA improving by approximately 22%. Our first quarter results reflect clear evidence that we are executing against our strategic initiatives to deliver profitable growth. Thanks to the focus and dedication of the BNED team, our efforts to drive operational efficiencies and cost reductions are taking hold and our First Day Complete equitable access model continues to demonstrate strong momentum. Before providing a more detailed review of the first quarter, Jonathan and I would like to highlight how the successful execution of these two strategic initiatives are impacting our results.First, I'll discuss our continued focus on operational improvement and efficiency. Within our retail segment, total sales of $245.5 million increased by $9 million or 3.8%. We achieved this growth despite operating 117 fewer stores, including 67 physical and 50 virtual stores versus a year ago, as we focus on winding down underperforming less profitable stores and satellite locations. Gross comparable store sales were up 5.9% driven by strength in course materials, supply products and graduation items. This growth combined with our disciplined cost management drove significant operating leverage. Retail, selling and administrative expense as a percent of revenue decreased by 520 basis points to 28.2% from 33.4% in the prior year period. This improvement is the direct result of our fiscal year 2023 cost restructuring activities, which yielded a $9.8 million year-over-year quarterly reduction in selling and administrative expense.Our store teams are operating with their characteristic commitment and increased focus on cost discipline to achieve these results. During our current fall rush, their performance has been exceptional as they continue to provide an unmatched in-store experience while implementing demanding new productivity standards tied to actively managing variable costs, including deep rigor on staffing levels and optimizing our labor mix of full and part-time team members. Further, our teams have adapted well to make sure our stores are meeting customer needs for fall rush despite the later arrival of certain inventory versus prior years. As we discussed with you last quarter, we successfully closed the amend and extend of our credit facilities on July 28th.These amendments provide us with the necessary financial flexibility and operating runway to actively pursue a more permanent capital structure to complete our business model transformation. However, certain vendors delayed shipping inventory until we received and applied the liquidity enhancements provided by the amendments. Our store teams supported by MBS and our retail shared services teams have been working nonstop to expedite receiving and present such inventory for sale to mitigate any impacts of such delays on our customers or our early rush period sales. Our second key initiative is the acceleration of our Equitable Access program, First Day Complete, which is one of the cornerstones of our long-term profitability growth plan. In the first quarter, First Day Complete revenue increased 55% year-over-year and First Day by course revenue grew 27%.The growth of our First Day models drove total course material sales up by 8.4%. Now I'll turn the call over to Jonathan Shar, President of Retail, to discuss the significant impact First Day Complete is having on students, higher education and on our business.Jonathan Shar: Thanks, Mike. It's been an exciting fall back-to-school season thus far as we now have a 157 campus stores using our First Day Complete subscription-like model, representing enrollment of nearly 800,000 undergraduate and postgraduate students, a 46% increase over the fall of 2022. Based upon the current pre add/drop enrollment and participation levels, we expect FDC billings for the fall term to be up more than 46%, which will be recognized as GAAP revenue primarily in the second quarter with a smaller relative amount recognized in our third quarter of fiscal year 2024. As I visited many campus stores over the last few weeks, it's clear that FDC, our equitable access model, is having a very positive impact on the student experience, which is why FDC's acceptance in the market has such positive momentum.The marketplace reaction to FDC strongly supports our strategy and conclusion that FDC will be the primary course material distribution model in the near future. As we shared with you last quarter, based on survey results from our Barnes & Noble College Insights platform, students reported overwhelmingly that through First Day Complete, they had a better customer experience, we're better prepared, saved money and ultimately achieved improved academic success. These benefits have been on full display throughout this fall rush. For students, acquiring required textbooks and course materials is one of the first tasks they need to accomplish at the beginning of each new academic term. First Day Complete has turned this initial task list item into a welcoming positive event through the ease of the First Day Complete process, leveraging our proprietary technology and commitment to service.As an example, at Emporia State University, which just launched FDC this fall term, a student nominated the Barnes & Noble College bookstore team for a Heart of a Hornet award which recognizes campus community members that go above and beyond in service excellence for how welcoming quick and easy the FDC program made acquiring course materials. The way First Day Complete has transformed the student experience is striking and provides further motivation to work with all our partner institutions to accelerate their adoptions to the First Day Complete model. We believe we are best positioned to deliver on the Equitable Access Model and continue to be the clear marketplace leader. We've invested in advanced proprietary software, such as our student-facing and personalized FDC customer platform, the adoption and insights portal for faculty and academic leadership and the seamless integrations we have with an institution systems like registration, student information, ERPs, learning management systems and single sign-on.Additionally, MBS is a critical component of our FDC fulfillment engine with unmatched warehousing and logistics capabilities and the industry's largest single source of affordable use textbooks. Being these unique mix of assets and capabilities, coupled with our experience in executing at scale have allowed us to provide flexible and customized solutions for the colleges and universities we serve, enabling us to add a record number of schools to the First Day Complete model this fall. First Day Complete also provides economic benefit to BNED. Since inception, the First Day Complete model has delivered increased predictability, higher revenue and improved gross margins and EBITDA at a school post transition. To demonstrate this, we examined the cohort of stores that transition the First Day Complete in the fall of 2022 from the a-la-carte model in the fall of 2021.On slide nine of our investor presentation, you can see that when a cohort of stores move to the First Day Complete, their course material sales increased by 82% year-over-year due to the ease of the subscription-like service and the much higher sell-through rate versus the a-la-carte model. Taking this a step further, the gross profit dollars of this cohort nearly doubled, increasing by 96% and drove a 200 basis point improvement in the gross profit margin to approximately 31% from 29%. Furthermore, as schools use FDC year after year, we are able to increase student participation rates. And as a result, the gross profit dollars of First Day Complete stores in fall of 2022 that also operated FDC in the fall of 2021 increased by 5.2% in fiscal year 2023.All this, of course, is only possible through the talent and passion of our BNED team. I'd like to recognize and thank some of our outstanding operating executives and their teams, like Brian Stark, Bill Dampier, Celeste Risimini-Johnson, Chris Sackett and others for their outstanding leadership and commitment to serving our clients and customers. It's inspiring to see our team members who are committed to our mission of serving all who work to elevate their lives through education. Now I'll turn the call back over to Mike to review our results in more detail.Michael Huseby: Thanks, Jonathan. Turning to a focus on the first quarter results and related matters. Consolidated first quarter revenue from continuing operations of $264.2 million grew by 3.7% or $9.5 million. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA grew by 21.8% or $7.5 million to a negative $26.8 million. As a reminder, our first quarter is a seasonally low volume period primarily consisting of summer classes, graduations and preparation for fall rush. Fiscal 2024 first quarter total retail segment revenue increased by $9 million or 3.8% to $245.5 million driven by an 8.4% increase in course material revenue and strong graduation and supply product sales. Within course material, our total First Day and First Day Complete revenues increased 37%.First quarter retail gross profit of $50.3 million decreased by $3.7 million or 6.9%, while retail gross margin of 20.5% decreased by 230 basis points from the prior year period. Course materials gross margin declined due to higher markdowns, including markdowns related to closed stores as well as a higher percentage of lower-margin digital course material sales. These decreases were partially offset by lower contract costs resulting from contract renewals and a favorable sales mix of higher margin graduation products. Additionally, as noted last quarter, first quarter retail gross margins were impacted by lower contractual commissions for emblematic general merchandise sales as part of the Fanatics and Lids partnership agreement. Effective August 1, 2023, under the terms of the July 2023 term loan credit agreement amendment, the commission rates for emblematic general merchandise increased for an estimated one year period.Each of these trends and margin impacts are reflected in the guidance we have provided. Retail EBITDA increased by $6.1 million to negative $18.9 million due to increased revenue, offset by a lower gross margin as noted and the $9.8 million year-over-year reduction in selling and administrative expense I mentioned earlier. Importantly, we believe we've adjusted and will continue to adjust the cost structure of the retail business to fundamentally change the profit profile of the business. This was evident in our lower volume first quarter, and we expect these expense reduction benefits to continue during our much higher volume second and third quarters. Moving onto wholesale. First quarter sales increased by $1.7 million or 4.6% to $38.8 million.The increase is primarily due to higher gross sales of $5.1 million compared to the prior year period partially offset by higher returns and allowances of $3.4 million. Wholesale gross profit was $5.8 million or 14.9% of sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to $6.9 million or 18.6% of sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Gross profit and gross margin rate decreased in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, primarily due to higher product costs and an increase in the returns and allowances, partially offset by lower markdowns. First quarter wholesale selling and administrative expenses decreased by 18% to $3.4 million. This decrease was primarily due to cost savings initiatives comprised of lower payroll and incentive plan compensation expense.Wholesale non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $2.4 million, down by $360,000 due to the lower gross margin. Moving onto the balance sheet and cash flow. Our cash balance was $7.7 million at the end of the quarter with outstanding borrowings of $278 million as compared to borrowings of $259 million in the prior year period. Cash flow used in operating activities increased due to timing of payables to vendors and increased receivables related to increased adoption of our First Day programs in the summer term. Merchandise inventories were down 17% or $79.4 million to $384.2 million versus the prior year. This reflects the delay in inventory delivery from the first quarter to the second quarter that I discussed earlier. First quarter capital expenditures decreased by $3.3 million to $4.2 million from $7.5 million due primarily to lower store build-out and internal systems spend.Regarding guidance, we're maintaining our fiscal 2024 adjusted EBITDA expectation of approximately $40 million. While the inventory delays during the first two weeks of fall rush resulted in lower sales than expected, we believe the current and expected First Day sales and our disciplined management of store payroll and other costs will limit the financial impact of the delayed inventory receipts. Before closing, I want to thank departing board members Emily Chiu and Dan DeMatteo for their contributions to the company. We are pleased to welcome two new directors Steve Panagos and Ray Wallander to the BNED Board. Both new directors bring fresh perspectives and highly relevant experience to BNED's continued transformation and we look forward to working closely with them.In addition, we are very pleased to announce this morning that Kevin Watson is joining us as our new Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer effective tomorrow. As you get to know, Kevin, I'm confident you'll agree that he has a strong addition to our senior management team at a very important time in BNED's strategic transformation. In summary, we had a solid first quarter, and we're encouraged by further scaled proof points that our strategy is working. Our First Day Complete equitable access model is having a significant positive impact on students, institutions and BNED. Our cost reduction and efficiency actions are improving profitability and we are on the path to consistently improving adjusted EBITDA and cash flows. I want to thank our people who daily show through their actions and unwavering commitment to our mission, customers and each other.The field and operating teams that Jonathan mentioned as well as our corporate affairs and legal team under Mike Miller's senior leadership. Our exceptional treasury team, led by Jason Snagusky and Joe Loraine and our finance and accounting teams led by Seema Paul and [indiscernible] have all made significant contributions as have others that are instrumental positioning us for success this fall and beyond. We believe in our opportunity to create value for all stakeholders. Our model transformation has clearly proved that this opportunity is within our grasp at scale. What really excites us is a significant market opportunity that's still in front of us and how well positioned we are to translate that opportunity to increase and sustainable value.I'll now turn the call over to the operator to open the line for questions. Operator?See also 30 Friendliest Cities in America and 10 Biggest Social Media Companies In Asia.Q&A SessionOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Ryan MacDonald from Needham. Your line is open.Ryan MacDonald: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Mike maybe just to start on the clarification on the inventory delays. Can you just provide a little more color about where you were feeling that most, whether it was on the course material side around the emblematic or general merchandise side? And what, if any, knock-on effects we should expect as a result of that for the fall rush?Michael Huseby: Yes, Ryan, thanks. We wanted to point this out. We don't consider this to be -- have any impact on our guidance for the year, but we did want to mention it because it's probably obvious, if you look at our balance sheet at the end of July, we had a huge payables balance as we are working to complete the amend and extend, which we did on July 28th, it became effective on the 31st when we got our clean opinion from our outside auditors. So there was a lot of pent-up cash that needed to be released to creditors, whether they were trade vendors, partners, whether they were publishers or in general merchandise both. We got that done fairly quickly. And fortunately, the delay was not in the two largest weeks of the first two weeks of August, in other words, they're not the most significant start dates for fall rush.That starts to happen really in the third week and fourth week of August and then you know guys that we have Labor Day and right after like where we are right now. So to answer your question directly, our priority was making sure that we got all the course materials vendors cleared up first. And in general, publishers reacted very swiftly and we're very helpful in terms of getting the inventory released to us. There were other categories of general merchandise that we didn't prioritize quite as highly in terms of trade stores and convenience and food and beverage and that type of thing. But nonetheless we doubled all of it pretty much in the first two weeks of August because we want the in-store experience for the students when they come into a rush to be a complete one.So we didn't want to overplay this. I don't think this is going to have a significant impact on our fall rush financial results or on the year but it's something that was so obvious. We thought we had to mention it. So it's across the board, but we did prioritize moving in courseware and related supplies that kids needed to get back to school or students need to get back to school. And then the other categories of general merchandise, we're being taken care of in parallel, but we're not prioritized in terms of payments quite as highly.Ryan MacDonald: All right. I appreciate the color on that. On First Day Complete, great to see the interesting and good results there. I'm curious, as you've gone into the fall rush here. First, what have opt-in rates looked like amongst the student population on the newer cohort of schools that have started? And then as we think about pipeline development for spring of 2024, how that continues to develop and what you've got kind of lined up for the spring rush as well? Thanks.Jonathan Shar: Yes. Ryan, it's Jonathan. Thanks for the question. And in the First Day Complete model, there's, just to clarify, there's sort of two models. One is it's built into tuition at certain schools where there isn't an opt-out. And then we have where it's listed as a course charge and students can opt=out of those. So we don't have an opt-in model per se. It's either included or opt-out -- and the -- for the schools that have opt-out, the opt-out period runs through the add/drop period, which we haven't hit at many of the institutions yet, which will come up in the next few weeks. So we don't really know, although the initial view is that participation rates are strong and one of the things we're seeing is the second and third years that an institution runs First Day Complete and there's cohorts that have experienced that, that participate patient rates grow or opt-out rates decline over time.So that's an exciting sort of metric that we're tracking and something that we've seen to be positive so far this year, although we haven't hit those add/drop periods, I don't know for sure where it will land, but some good trends in what we're seeing with First Day Complete is based on the overall experience and impact that it's having on the student experience and driving affordability and providing access to materials for all the students at those institutions.Ryan MacDonald: And maybe just on the second part of that pipeline for spring of '24, how is that looking so far?Jonathan Shar: Yes. We're in active conversation still with many schools to launch First Day Complete for spring. In fact, we have some signed amendments and agreements already in place. And then we're having still daily hundreds of conversations with schools focused on launching in the next academic year, which will be a year from now in fall of calendar 2024, which is really exciting. So those conversations are active. They have accelerated and we're really optimistic about the continued growth of institutions participating in First Day Complete. And it's really based on the impact that we've seen on student outcomes, access, affordability and convenience.Ryan MacDonald: Excellent. Maybe just one more for me for Mike. I think you talked about 117 fewer stores year-over-year and doing a nice job of driving more profitable business off of -- despite sort of fewer stores. Can you give us a sense of what the runway looks like here for additional store wind-downs? And sort of how much is there left to go in terms of sort of winding down those unprofitable contracts? And when we might sort of hit the trough, I guess, of impact and start to benefit on the other side of this? Thanks.Michael Huseby: Yes, it's a great question. It's something that we look at constantly. As you know, Ryan, our overall strategy is based on serving stores profitably. And we're continuing to work with stores to improve profitability. So the trough, as you call it, is really going to be dependent upon our success in converting some stores, many stores to First Day Complete and thereby increasing the profitability, getting it at a level that's a good, long-term, healthy relationship for both us and the school. As you said, our store count was down 117 and that included 67 fiscal 50 virtual stores versus a year ago. So that is evidence that we're following the strategy that's reflected in the results. In terms of giving you guidance on the runway and that type of thing, we're not going to do that, but we'll do it each quarter because of what I just mentioned, it's very dependent upon, and Jon said, as Jon said, we're engaged in a lot of conversations with school still about not just converting to First Day Complete, but the other economic terms that impact our relationship with the commission rate that we pay the schools and we're controlled doing a great job.Our field teams doing a great job of controlling the payroll. So there are different levers we can pull to achieve profitability in stores. And so how successful we are in pulling those levers renewing contracts and making that strategy work is going to answer the question of where is the trough. I mean we expect to go to a lower number of stores next year than where we are this year. But at some point in time, as First Day Complete penetration, as I would call it, our sell-through really becomes a much higher percentage we should start adding back to that number stores at some point. I don't know when that's going to happen. But our expectation is that all stores will be on some form of equitable access at some point in time.Ryan MacDonald: Thanks for taking my questions. I'll hop back in the queue.Michael Huseby: Thanks, Ryan.Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Fuhrman from Craig-Hallum Capital Group. Your line is open.Alex Fuhrman: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Can you talk a little bit about what the impact has been on general merchandise sales at schools that have transitioned the First Day Complete. Has there been any sort of a negative traffic impact just from having fewer students making that first trip to the bookstore to shop for their books? And then would love to just kind of further unpack your comments about driving really strong merchandise sales on a smaller number of bookstores? And can you just kind of help us understand what was driving that increase? Obviously, this is a seasonally slower period of the year for you, but just trying to understand what that's going to look like as we get into the rest of the year?Michael Huseby: Alex, it's Mike. I'll make one general comment and then Jon has been spending a lot of time in our stores during rush can pick it up. First off, there aren't fewer students driven to the store through First Day Complete, if anything, there are more. Because most of those programs result in students coming in to pick up their First Day Complete package, of course, we're on or before the First Day. So that as opposed to more of a random who's going to show up when from a student perspective, it's fairly predictable in terms of store traffic, in terms of the scale of students that are showing up to pick up First Day Complete. So and I don't think our results having analyzed this would not indicate that we have any falloff in a general merchandise sale kind of on a per student basis as we change the model then I'll let Jon give more details.Jonathan Shar: No, that's exactly right. We're actually seeing more students come into the store post transition to First Day Complete based on the fact that we're serving nearly all of the students at that institution. And the primary sort of fulfillment channel is in-store pickup. We can ship the materials to students if they select, but most of them from a convenience standpoint come into the store and pick up their materials or go through the process in real time and have us pick them and sort of box up their materials for them for distribution. So it's actually an opportunity through some of the merchandising strategies and cross merchandising strategies that we have to increase the sales of everything else in the store like general merchandise items that we sell to students as part of that visit.So we're actually optimistic that, that's going to have a positive impact. And just from a store traffic point alone. So we think that the model works well with the other parts of our business that we are looking to continue to drive growth in.Alex Fuhrman: Okay. That's really helpful. And then just the other part of the question, just thinking about the strong merchandise sales despite the pretty significantly smaller number of stores that you were operating during the quarter. I mean can we interpret that to mean that your biggest, most kind of long-standing profitable stores we're experiencing really strong increases in sales during the summer months or was it part of that maybe just driven by the fact that the 100 something stores that you're no longer operating were just pretty small contributors to merchandise?Michael Huseby: Yes, I think it's a combination of both of those. And as we called out in some of the prepared remarks, we had very strong summer, early summer first quarter in graduation products, which was somewhat of a surprise to us, quite frankly, we planned on. We did a lot of great things in our merchandising group to make that happen. But if you recall last year in the spring and summer of '22. There are many schools that actually had commencement ceremonies to include more than just one graduating class because of the impacts of COVID and the fact that many schools weren't able to walk graduating classes in prior years. So even with that as a benchmark, the graduation products performed better year-over-year and much better and of course with our expectations.So that was a big part actually of the contribution of general merchandise growth. As it relates to the other categories, we continue to see good performance, but graduation was one that really stood out for us in the first quarter. The other thing I would say is that it impacts both the digital kind of the digital weighting of sales and the margin and also a number of students on campus. There were many schools this year that had online virtual courses this summer more than actually in the number we expected. So even with that and not having as many students on campus for the summer, general merchandise sales did well.Alex Fuhrman: Okay. That's really helpful. Thank you.Operator: And we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Hunter Blankenbaker for some final closing remarks.Hunter Blankenbaker: Great. Thank you, Rob. That does conclude our call and we're going to get back to Fall Rush here. We look to -- forward to speaking with you in early December on our second quarter call. Thank you.Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."

You should not draw any conclusions about any of these Funds' investment performance from the amount of the distributions.MANAGED DISTRIBUTION POLICY FUNDSANNOUNCE DISTRIBUTION PAYMENT DETAILSabrdn Global Infrastructure Income Fund (""ASGI"")The above-noted abrdn U.S. Closed-End Funds (the ""Funds"" or individually the ""Fund""), today announced that the Funds will pay the distributions noted in the chart above on September 29, 2023, on a per share basis to all shareholders of record as of September 22, 2023 (ex-dividend date September 21, 2023).Each Fund has adopted a distribution policy to provide investors with a stable distribution out of current income, supplemented by realized capital gains and, to the extent necessary, paid-in capital in reliance on an exemptive order granted by the Securities and Exchange Commission.Story continuesUnder applicable U.S. tax rules, the amount and character of distributable income for each Fund's fiscal year can be finally determined only as of the end of the Fund's fiscal year. However, under Section 19 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the ""1940 Act"") and related rules, the Funds may be required to indicate to shareholders the estimated source of certain distributions to shareholders.The following tables set forth the estimated amounts of the sources of the distributions for purposes of Section 19 of the 1940 Act and the rules adopted thereunder. The tables have been computed based on generally accepted accounting principles. The tables include estimated amounts and percentages for the current distributions to be paid as well as for the cumulative distributions paid relating to fiscal year to date, from the following sources: net investment income; net realized short-term capital gains; net realized long-term capital gains; and return of capital. The estimated compositions of the distributions may vary because the estimated composition may be impacted by future income, expenses and realized gains and losses on securities and currencies.The Fund's estimated sources of the current distributions to be paid and for its current fiscal year to date are as follows:Estimated Amounts of Current Distribution per ShareFundDistribution AmountNet Investment IncomeNet Realized Short-Term Gains*Net Realized Long-Term GainsReturn of CapitalASGI$0.1200$0.028824%$0.013211%$0.078065%--Estimated Amounts of Fiscal Year to Date Cumulative Distributions per ShareFundFiscal Year** to Date Distribution AmountNet Investment IncomeNet Realized Short-Term Gains*Net Realized Long-Term GainsReturn of CapitalASGI$1.4400$0.345624%$0.158411%$0.936065%--* includes currency gains** ASGI has a 9/30 fiscal year end.Where the estimated amounts above show a portion of the distribution to be a ""Return of Capital,"" it means that the Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and capital gains; therefore, a portion of your distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur for example, when some or all the money that you invested in a Fund is paid back to you. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with ""yield"" or ""income.""The amounts and sources of distributions reported in this notice are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The final determination of the source of all distributions for the current year will only be made after year-end. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of the fiscal year and may be subject to change based on tax regulations. After the end of each calendar year, a Form 1099-DIV will be sent to shareholders for the prior calendar year that will tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes.The following table provides the Fund's total return performance based on net asset value (NAV) over various time periods compared to the Fund's annualized and cumulative distribution rates.Fund Performance and Distribution Rate InformationFundAverage Annual Total Return on NAV for the 5 Year Period Ending 08/31/2023&sup1;Current Fiscal Period's Annualized Distribution Rate on NAV&sup2;Cumulative Total Return on NAV&sup1;Cumulative Distribution Rate on NAV&sup2;ASGI37.71%37.07%16.90%6.48%1 Return data is net of all fund expenses and fees and assumes the reinvestment of all distributions reinvested at prices obtained under the Fund's dividend reinvestment plan, with the exception of the most recent distribution.2 Based on the Fund's NAV as of August 31, 2023.3 The Fund launched within the past 5 years; the performance and distribution rate information presented reflects data from inception (July 29, 2020) through August 31, 2023.Shareholders should not draw any conclusions about a Fund's investment performance from the amount of the Fund's current distributions or from the terms of the distribution policy (the ""Distribution Policy"").While NAV performance may be indicative of the Fund's investment performance, it does not measure the value of a shareholder's investment in the Fund. The value of a shareholder's investment in the Fund is determined by the Fund's market price, which is based on the supply and demand for the Fund's shares in the open market.Pursuant to an exemptive order granted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Funds may distribute any long-term capital gains more frequently than the limits provided in Section 19(b) under the 1940 Act and Rule 19b-1 thereunder. Therefore, distributions paid by the Funds during the year may include net income, short-term capital gains, long-term capital gains and/or a return of capital. Net income dividends and short-term capital gain dividends, while generally taxable at ordinary income rates, may be eligible, to the extent of qualified dividend income earned by the Funds, to be taxed at a lower rate not to exceed the maximum rate applicable to your long-term capital gains. Distributions made in any calendar year in excess of investment company taxable income and net capital gain are treated as taxable ordinary dividends to the extent of undistributed earnings and profits, and then as a return of capital that reduces the adjusted basis in the shares held. To the extent return of capital distributions exceed the adjusted basis in the shares held, capital gain is recognized with a holding period based on the period the shares have been held at the date such amount is received.The payment of distributions in accordance with the Distribution Policy may result in a decrease in the Fund's net assets. A decrease in the Fund's net assets may cause an increase in the Fund's annual operating expense ratio and a decrease in the Fund's market price per share to the extent the market price correlates closely to the Fund's net asset value per share. The Distribution Policy may also negatively affect the Fund's investment activities to the extent that the Fund is required to hold larger cash positions than it typically would hold or to the extent that the Fund must liquidate securities that it would not have sold, for the purpose of paying the distribution. Each Fund's Board has the right to amend, suspend or terminate the Distribution Policy at any time. The amendment, suspension or termination of the Distribution Policy may affect the Fund's market price per share.

LoydThanks, Brandi. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us for today's call. We appreciate everyone's interest in our reporting of our successful fiscal 2023 operational and financial results. However, before we begin to discuss our recent results, I would first like to make some general comments related to the announcement we put out this morning with PEDEVCO concerning our definitive participation agreement to jointly develop the Chaveroo oil field in the Northwest Shelf of Southern New Mexico. It's a conventional oil-bearing San Andres field in the Permian Basin located in Chavez County.We're proud to partner with PEDEVCO, a company that shares our values and goals of providing superior total returns to shareholders. I will let Mark go into the details of the strategic partnership later, but I want to point out the biggest highlight of this arrangement first. The deal adds a new and exciting arrow in our quiver of capital allocation opportunities.In the past, in order to grow our production and reserves, we have relied heavily on the A&D market. While we've been quite successful and plan to continue that strategy, the 80-plus high-quality locations covered by this agreement will allow Evolution to grow or maintain its production and reserves even in times where asset-level transactions are priced at what we consider to be unattractive levels. In turn, we believe this will be highly supportive to our dividend program for years to come. The wells here are 90-plus percent oil and located in the Permian Basin, which is an important market to which we want to be exposed.Now on to our fiscal 2023 results. Our results for the period were solid and continued to demonstrate our assets' ability to generate strong free cash flow. We used our cash flow to once again fund operations, capital spending and shareholder dividends. In addition, I'm pleased to report that we repaid $21.5 million of debt, again, all from cash flow and exited the year with a debt-free balance sheet and increased liquidity.We continue generating meaningful free cash flow from the acquisitions completed over the previous years, and we'll use these to continue to fund our strategic objectives. Of course, our ongoing success is a direct reflection of the hard work and accomplishments of our team. I want to thank each and every member of the Evolution team for their contributions and continued dedication to driving near and long-term value for our shareholders.During the fiscal year, we paid cash dividends totaling $0.48 per common share. This was 37% higher than for fiscal 2022, which we view as a clear indicator of the growth and strength of our business. Our board recently declared a cash dividend of $0.12 per share for fiscal Q1 2024, payable on September 29, marking the payment of our 40th consecutive quarterly dividend. Since the company began paying dividends in December of 2013, we've returned approximately $102.4 million or $3.09 per share of capital to investors.As we have discussed in the past, there are very few small-cap E&P companies that can say they have consistently paid a dividend for that length of time throughout several tumultuous commodity price cycles. We believe this reinforces the strategic view our board takes as we prudently grow the business through the targeted acquisition of solid, long-life and low-decline assets that will continue to support a sustainable quarterly dividend for the immediate and long term. In short, maintaining and ultimately growing the payment of a quarterly cash dividend remains front and center for our board and management team.I will now turn the call over to Mark to discuss operations.J. Mark BunchThanks, Kelly. Total production for the fourth quarter fiscal 2023 was 6,484 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, consisting of 1,736 barrels per day of crude oil, 22,462 thousand cubic feet per day of natural gas and 1,000 barrels per day of natural gas liquids. Looking at our fourth quarter results in more detail, oil decreased 6% from 1,856 barrels of oil per day in the prior quarter, primarily due to downtime at the Delhi Field, where production was shut in for approximately 1 week to upgrade the facilities and install a heat exchanger to increase plant deficiencies.Natural gas production decreased 8% from 24,489 thousand cubic feet per day or 4,077 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the prior quarter, primarily due to downtime in the Barnett Shale properties associated with extreme similar weather conditions along with gathering line maintenance and compressor issues. NGL production decreased 13% from 1,156 barrels of NGLs per day in the prior quarter, primarily attributed to downtime at Delhi Field properties to install the heat exchanger, perform NGL plant maintenance. At our Barnett Shale properties, our NGL volumes were affected by the same factors that impacted our natural gas production.Looking at our full year results in more detail. Total production for the full year fiscal 2023 was 7,104 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, consisting of 1,806 barrels per day of crude oil, 24,956 thousand cubic feet per day of natural gas and 1,140 barrels per day of NGLs. Oil increased 6% from 1,696 barrels of oil per day in the prior year, primarily due to our acquisitions of non-operated working interest in the Jonah Field and the Williston Basin in the second half of fiscal 2020. This increase was offset by the downtime in fiscal 2023 at the Delhi Field, as mentioned previously.Natural gas production increased 28% from 19,564 thousand cubic feet per day in the prior year, primarily due to acquisitions of non-operated working interest in the Jonah Field and the Williston Basin in the second half of fiscal 2022. The increase is partially offset by downtime in our Barnett Shale properties, as I mentioned previously.NGL production increased 14% from 997 barrels of NGLs per day in the prior year, primarily attributable to the 2 acquisitions in fiscal 2022, offset by decreases attributed to downtime at our Delhi Field and the same factors that impacted our natural gas production in our Barnett Shale properties, as mentioned previously.Based on discussion with our operators, we expect capital workover projects to continue in all the fields. Overall, for fiscal year 2024, we expect budgeted capital to be in the range of $4 million to $5 million, which excludes any potential acquisitions. Our expected capital expenditures for the next 12 months include 2 new drill wells at Delhi Field, drilled by our operator, Denbury.As Kelly already said, we're really excited about our strategic partnership with PEDEVCO in the Permian. The agreement covers approximately 25,000 gross acres in and around the Chaveroo Field in Northeast New Mexico. The Chaveroo Field was originally developed targeting the San Andres formation with vertical wells on 40-acre spacing. We view the horizontal development of the San Andres and the Chaveroo Field to be very compelling based on extensive vertical well control, the data and results from previous PEDEVCO horizontal wells and analog developments of other 40-acre non-water flooded vertical San Andres fields.We expect this project will significantly contribute to the successive evolution for years to come. We expect our CapEx to increase over the $4 million to $5 million budgeted for our existing assets due to drilling and completing expected 3 wells in this fiscal year. The ultimate amount of capital spent during fiscal year 2024 for drilling in the Permian will depend on the schedule agreed to with our partner.With that, I will turn the call back over to Ryan to discuss our financial highlights.Ryan StashThanks, Mark. As mentioned earlier, please refer to yesterday's earnings release for additional information concerning our results. My comments today will primarily focus on financial highlights and comparative results between fiscal 2023 and 2022.During the fourth quarter, we experienced extended downtime and maintenance across multiple assets and we're negatively impacted by much lower realized natural gas and NGL prices. However, our fiscal year 2023 results still represented record revenue, production and net income. During the past fiscal year, we had solid generation of cash flow, including adjusted EBITDA, which was $60.1 million for the current year compared to $52.8 million in the prior year, a 14% increase.During this fiscal year, we funded our operations, development capital expenditures, dividends and share repurchases, all out of operating cash flow while also paying down debt drawn for our acquisitions. Supported by our continued strong operational and cash flow outlook, we paid a dividend of $0.12 per share in the fourth quarter and declared a dividend of $0.12 per share for fiscal Q1 of 2024, payable on September 29. Our cash dividend program has been and will continue to be a top priority as we clearly recognize the strategic importance of returning value to our shareholders.We ended the fiscal year debt-free and our borrowing base remained at $50 million. On June 30, 2023, cash and cash equivalents totaled $11 million and working capital was $8.9 million. As a result, total liquidity on June 30, 2023, was $61 million, including cash and cash equivalents. This represents an increase in liquidity of 65% since June 30, 2022. This is a direct result of our targeted and immediately accretive acquisitions over the past couple of years. We are ideally positioned for the continued execution of targeted future growth opportunities that meet our strategic vision.Lease operating costs increased to $59.5 million from $48.7 million in fiscal 2022, primarily driving the overall increase was the acquisitions of the Jonah Field and Williston Basin, which occurred in the latter half of fiscal year 2022. Cash G&A expenses increased 18% to $7.9 million from $6.7 million in fiscal year 2022. The increase in expenses is due to approximately $600,000 in salary employee benefits from the addition of personnel added since the prior year and $300,000 in professional fees associated with our search for a CEO.Also contributing to the increase are additional fees for accounting and audit-related services and public reporting expenses due to the increased size of our company. Net income for the fiscal year was $35.2 million or $1.04 per diluted share compared to $32.6 million or $0.96 per diluted share in fiscal year 2022.I'll now turn the call back over to Kelly for his closing remarks.Kelly W. LoydThanks, Ryan. We continue to benefit from the targeted acquisitions we have completed over the past few years. And as a result, we enjoy a larger and more geographically diverse asset base and commodity mix. This provides us with a solid platform for significant cash flow generation that we will continue to use to support and enhance our well-established shareholder capital return program. Our shareholders expect a consistent and meaningful cash return on their investment, and we remain committed to maintaining and, as appropriate, increasing our dividend payout over time.As in the past, we will maintain a conservative balance sheet and remain disciplined in our management of capital as we fully recognize the cyclicality of our business. Our ongoing commitment to remaining fiscally prudent was evidenced by our prompt pay down of our debt position following the closing of our most recent acquisitions. As a result, we are well positioned to execute on targeted high rate of return and immediately accretive growth opportunities as appropriate. We will continue to execute our strategic plan focused on maximizing total shareholder returns and optimizing every dollar that we invest.With today's announcement, we have added an opportunity to have a meaningful organic growth component. As with all of our capital allocation decisions, any drilling here must compete with dollars to be used elsewhere, and the nature of this arrangement will allow for that.We are not required to pay upfront for anything other than the acreage cost for the immediate development block, which we will be developing next. This is unlike other situations where companies must pay in advance for entry into a field and prepay for well locations. This is a true strategic partnership where development will occur sequentially with the decision moved forward based on success. We and PEDEVCO expect that this partnership will produce positive results for many years to come.With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions. Thank you.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from John White of Roth Capital.John Marshall WhiteCongratulations on the PEDEVCO deal. I agree with you. I think it was very attractive.Kelly W. LoydThank you, John. John, can -- before we get to your question, can I just make one additional comment?John Marshall WhiteYes, of course.Kelly W. LoydOkay. So I just want to reiterate, as I've said before, that we -- when we and the Board, we set dividends, we do so with a multiyear horizon expectation based on our production and resulting cash flow that is generated from our forecasted pricing and production levels. With this in mind, we fully expect that our cash flow, combined with our pristine balance sheet and our cash and cash equivalents will be able to more than fully cover our dividend, which, by the way, we just reset at $0.12 per share.Not only do we believe it will fully cover our dividend, it should cover all of our capital needs up to and including any planned drilling activity. We're confident, as you mentioned, John, that this strategic partnership will be highly supportive of our dividend for quite some time.John Marshall WhiteOkay. I appreciate that add-on. So regarding the PEDEVCO deal, with respect to capital expenditures, Mr. [Bunch] offered some commentary. However, his commentary was, I would say, highly conditioned or highly qualified. Can you offer any more detail about the potential CapEx at the PEDEVCO deal, maybe put it in terms of a minimum or a maximum or a 6-month timeframe or a 12-month timeframe? Whatever you're comfortable.Kelly W. LoydI can -- absolutely. Look, these are fluid and there are plans that we're going to come up with and finalized with our partner, PEDEVCO. Initially, I'll tell you what we're both thinking on this. We have an initial 3-well pad, which we're working on. It's been permitted. The expectation is that we want to get to that 3-well pad sooner rather than later. Again, we need to finalize all the details.In general, the way we thought about this is basically, again, fluid can change depending on conditions environments, all this, but essentially about 8 wells gross per year is in general, how we've started thinking about the budget on this together. So again, 3 wells at roughly $3 million per copy or half of that is 4.5%, and we have acreage payments. So $4.5 million to $5 million would be our expectation for the initial 3-well pad.And then as I mentioned, the initial goal, again, which is highly dynamic and fluid, and we'll adjust as we go. But at least our initial sort of game plan is roughly around 8 wells per year together, which we'd be 50% of.John Marshall WhiteThat's a lot of extra detail, and I really appreciate that, Kelly. So on the maintenance or some of the infrastructure work, let's just make sure we understand. Is the work at Delhi, is that all completed? Is the heat exchanger installed and working?J. Mark BunchJohn, this is Mark Bunch. And the heat exchanger is up and running. The plant turnaround was completed. And so we expect that Delhi is back running at rated load. So we're -- we see that Delhi is performing as we would be expected to.John Marshall WhiteOkay. And same question on the Barnett Shale with the gathering line maintenance and compressor issues.J. Mark BunchThe Barnett Shale that was all obviously related to compressor and gathering stuff. We see that that is -- we believe that that is kind of generally on the mend. But as of right now, we don't know whether that is -- whether it is completely back up and running as it's supposed to be.Kelly W. LoydAs you know, John, when it's 112 degrees in Fort Worth, compressors don't always act properly, and they're going to run into issues, which clearly they did for much of the summer. But I think we're starting to see that get better.OperatorThe next question comes from Donovan Schafer of Northland Capital Markets.Donovan Due SchaferAnd I'm sure you know this, but it's Donovan Schafer. So I want to start picking up where John left off. The -- so we covered the Delhi and the Barnett. But in the Williston, and this could actually, honestly, be a data entry error on my part, haven't been able to double check this, but it looks like the Williston was down quite a bit too. Am I just wrong on that? I have that Williston's down something like north of 10% quarter-over-quarter. So was there a decline there? Or is that just an error in my model? And then what was the cause?J. Mark BunchDonovan, this is Mark Bunch. And there was -- during 1 month, we had a downtime on the compression side there, and so it affected NGLs, it also affected gas production. And that's the main cause there.Donovan Due SchaferWell, I'm talking about -- you're saying this is true for the -- that this is the Bakken, the Williston?J. Mark BunchYes, yes. Yes. For the Williston.Donovan Due SchaferReally? Okay. Also there -- the compression issues in both?J. Mark BunchYes.Donovan Due SchaferAnd also a compressor down in the Barnett? Okay. Got it. Okay. Okay. And then I want to turn to -- so for the year-over-year production and maybe Ryan has this information. But for the full year, the year-over-year production numbers were good but of course, part of that comes from the Jonah and the Williston acquisition, having a partial contribution last year and having a full year contribution this year.So is there anything you can give us in terms of to be able to kind of compare apples-to-apples either last year versus this year kind of including those pro forma for the full year last year or we're stripping them out just like what the apples-to-apples change in production, presumably some amount of decline? Do you have that information?Ryan StashYes. Don, we haven't done a full pro forma. We tend to look at it sequentially, right, quarter-to-quarter. And so we can try to come back with you on that for trying to pro forma out those acquisitions or as if we own them the full year. But I mean, ultimately, I think the -- at the end of the day, right, we have seen declines in the assets for natural reasons, but this last fourth quarter, unfortunately, we got hit with maintenance in 3 of our fields, which are major asset fields extended downtime combined with pretty much the lowest prices we've seen realized in 2 years. So unfortunately, it wasn't great timing for all of us, but we can certainly get back to you on what we think the -- if you're trying to get to what the actual field decline is, field by field kind of --Donovan Due SchaferYes or just getting into kind of your blended decline factoring out those step function increases from transactions. So I guess, if you could -- if that is something you feel like you know the answer to, are we still sitting at a, I don't know, 5% annual decline rate for in a business-as-usual situation without incremental acquisitions or where do you think (inaudible) decline rate endpoint?Ryan StashI think we've guided before to like high single digit to 10% sort of annual decline.Donovan Due SchaferYes, yes.Ryan StashYes. We don't -- I don't think that that's necessarily changed, but the fourth quarter obviously is going to throw some things off when you're looking at a decline rate.Donovan Due SchaferAnd then I also want to --Kelly W. LoydHey, Donovan?Donovan Due SchaferYes, go ahead.J. Mark BunchYes, just a quick deal. And I want to make sure you understand like the Williston, that compression issue was resolved also during the quarter. It was just a 1-month downtime and it's back up.Donovan Due SchaferOkay. And so then from a kind of -- I mean, I know you don't give guidance, but maybe does it -- is it reasonable for us to think there will be kind of like a reversal of things where there's kind of a, I don't know, a pop might be too strong of a word, but a movement back up in terms of total production numbers going like from this quarter to the next quarter just because a lot of that has been fixed, and there's a little bit of an upward movement just to get back on to a normalized decline path. Is that a fair expectation?Kelly W. LoydYes. Donovan, in order to avoid guidance, we won't say a whole lot on that. But I think you understand that there were some unique events that happened, so.Donovan Due SchaferOkay. And then I think John did ask about the PEDEVCO cost associated with that. You may have been asked us too maybe I missed it, but just kind of the time line of when that would start to contribute some amount of incremental production.Kelly W. LoydSo again, that's something we are working with them on. I think both parties are incentivized and excited to get those initial 3-well pad anyway going as soon as practical, and we're both comfortable doing that. So I'm not going to give you any specific timing, but I -- look, I'm hopeful it will be sooner rather than later and expect that, so.Donovan Due SchaferAnd this is similar conceptually to what you guys did in the Williston, right? I mean, there might be some differences to the terms of the same idea of having a way an avenue through which you can drive growth when it's not an attractive market for M&A. Is that -- are they -- is it appropriate to kind of put the two in the same bucket?Kelly W. LoydIt is. And in our mind, those are -- they will compete for capital just like everything else we do with our next marginal dollar. We -- at this time, look, we think the economics are very attractive in the Chaveroo Field with PEDEVCO. So that -- absolutely, yes. And these are just -- it's going to a point where they've moved to the front of the line. We think they're very good economics.Donovan Due SchaferAnd can you talk about how you source the deal? Just, I know that sometimes there can be some interesting nuggets there. Did this come in through a typical channel or it's the relationships you already have, they came to you and knew you'd be interested in some conventional stuff. And I know this isn't technically EOR, but you kind of understand you're familiar with this type of taking a second pass of things. So, yeah, how does this kind of come about?Kelly W. LoydWell, it mostly came about -- I got a call from Doug Schick at PEDEVCO, whom I've known for several years. We actually used to coach Pee Wee football against each other. And I've known Doug and we've spoken over the years about various business deals. And I believe Doug had an adviser looking in to do something. I think it was the Roth guys who have been very good for them. And so it made a natural sense. It's nice to do business with someone you can trust.OperatorThe next question comes from Jeff Robertson of Water Tower Research.Jeffrey Woolf RobertsonMark, one question on the downtime. Are you aware of any service interruptions that you expect over the next couple of quarters from your midstream providers in the Barnett Shale?J. Mark BunchNo, not really.Ryan StashWe wish they'd let us know when they're going to do that, but they unfortunately, don't. I mean, I think we talked about this before, right? So EnLink took over for Crestwood, right? When Crestwood sold the system. And they've had extended growing pains of trying to optimize the way they run the area. Our operator and partner, Diversified has certainly talked to them a lot. And so we certainly hope and are expecting them to do a better job going forward. But unfortunately, they're not going to give us any insight as to when they're going to have downtime or issues, unfortunately.Jeffrey Woolf RobertsonI've partially read through the operating agreement that I think was filed in an 8-K by PEDEVCO this morning. Kelly, with respect to the initial 3 wells, I think you said the goal would be to spud the first one by the end of this year. Would your expectation be to drill all 3 of those back to back and then complete them back to back? Or would it be 1 well drilled 1 well completed? Can you talk about how you think about that initial pad development?Kelly W. LoydI'll let Mark talk a little bit more to that. But look, just from an economic standpoint, drilling them on a pad as a package is a better deal. So that's certainly our expectation, but.J. Mark BunchYes. No, they'll be drilled back to back and then completed back-to-back. That's the expectation right now because that's the most -- makes the most economically viable way to do it, and then they'll be brought online at the same time.Jeffrey Woolf RobertsonAnd in terms of infrastructure, Mark, I know there's -- you all would share, I believe, in any infrastructure costs related to the production facilities. Can you just talk about what's in the area that you can move oil into? I know it was developed initially with vertical wells?J. Mark BunchYes. The plan right now is really not to use any of the vertical well facilities because the wells -- the horizontal wells are so much more prolific than the vertical wells. So the costs that we're -- with the capital costs that we're looking at are actually involved putting in new infrastructure, putting in new tank batteries also. And we'll optimize that for being horizontal wells.Jeffrey Woolf RobertsonMark, from what I've read about horizontals san Andreas wells, it's not an unconventional formation in most areas. So the initial decline rate is not as steep as more as a shale formation. Is that true in this area as well?J. Mark BunchYes. I would say that typically, in a Wolfcamp -- say like the Delaware part of the Permian where you have the Wolfcamp, those decline rates are probably above 95%. Here, it's going to be less than that.Jeffrey Woolf RobertsonAnd then just lastly on funding, Kelly, you mentioned in your remarks or maybe Ryan, in terms of funding the capital program, funding the drilling program with available liquidity, and it appears you still have -- will have the flexibility or could have the flexibility to continue to fund the dividend. And so that really shouldn't be at risk at this point. Is that --Kelly W. LoydYes. Look, dividend is first. So it's -- I don't want to put that in the opposite order. So yes, for sure.OperatorOur next question comes from David Locke of Old Mammoth Investments.David LockeSo I think you've kind of answered these questions, but I just want to answer them -- I just want to ask them again for clarity. So as it related to the downtime, particularly at Delhi, but also in the Barnett, would you expect that those compression issues being fixed would get production in those particular areas back to where they were in March as we go forward?Kelly W. LoydSo listen, it's -- we do expect as those compression issues get better, you will see better results. So I'll say that.David LockeAnd then for some clarity on the Permian assets, I'm just trying to triangulate a few things that you said. So 4 gross wells a year is the expectation. And you think you can fund -- sorry?Kelly W. Loyd8 gross wells. 4 net.David LockeI'm sorry. Did I say 4? My apologies. So 4 to you. So do you expect that you can fund that and the dividend out of free cash flow under sort of the -- if we look at the forward curve for oil and gas today?John Marshall WhiteThat's right. Yes. No, that's right, David. I mean, we -- when we look at where pricing is, like you said, in the forward curve, obviously, assuming oil has already increased from what we saw in the fourth quarter, so of NGLs and just citing aside, right, NGLs in the fourth quarter (inaudible) been a long time and so that certainly impacts us too. But when you take prices into consideration, free cash flow that our other assets generate plus cash that we're going to get from drilling the PEDEVCO, right? There is some delay there, but we do think this asset becomes self-funding pretty quickly. We don't see any issue covering the dividend plus funding our proportionate share of 8 wells per year.Kelly W. LoydHonestly, that's -- just to reiterate, that's one of the things that we're excited about with this deal is the money we're spending goes into the ground and drills wells. We're paying for acreage to get in on a block-by-block basis, but that's a relatively small number. The rest of the money goes into the ground. It starts producing oil, again, probably within about Mark, 60 days?J. Mark BunchYes. Longer than that, but somewhere -- very reasonable timeframe. Maybe 3 months frame.Kelly W. LoydFor when the money gets spent to when you start getting revenue from the oil -- from the wells you drilled. It's not a huge multiyear payback. You got to pay up front and then you get paid back. We and PEDEVCO excited about the fact that the money going in to this goes into the ground and then starts making oil for both of us.David LockeUnder the understanding that there is a delay between when you spend the money and when the oil starts coming, would you expect that the expenditure of this capital on a pro forma basis would, at a minimum, offset the declines in the other assets of the portfolio?Kelly W. LoydSo I'm not sure I'm prepared to go into that level of detail. But look, we're certainly not on the wrong track.David LockeOkay. And then if I could sort of cycle back to the Williston assets, which I guess you guys have owned for the better part of 18 months now or maybe that's the date of announcement, not the date of closing. But --J. Mark BunchThat's pretty good.David LockeWe had talked several times on previous conference calls about maybe putting development capital into those assets. And -- well, again, we're sitting here 18 months later and that really hasn't happened. So why has development capital not gone there? What's holding it up? What makes these Permian assets look superior to you because if I didn't misunderstand, you said a few minutes ago that they have kind of jumped to the line?Kelly W. LoydOkay. So yes, I mean, when -- again, this was primarily, like first and foremost, the Williston acquisition was evaluated and primarily in a large, large way purchase because it was a great PDP purchase. We really like the existing assets and how they're producing. It also had drilling locations, which at the time, when we evaluate them, there was a -- the drilling and completing cost was -- I don't remember what it is, but let's just say it was a certain number. Very shortly after that number moved up 20%, 30%, which again, it makes the returns pretty good. But the risk associated with drilling them and in the return you've got, it's still something that we think is attractive. It just -- it didn't jump out at us that we need to go do now.If you see some -- there's been plenty of inflation across the service sector. So if we could see those prices abate some, then that project becomes certainly more attractive. But at this point in time, with the current drilling costs that are out there in the world today and a very modern AFE, which we reviewed, the returns here are just, like I said, superior to the wells there.David LockeSo would you consider that those wells, the Williston development opportunity to still be in sort of like a theoretical backlog subject to some combination of oil price and service cost?Kelly W. LoydAbsolutely, yes.David LockeAnd then again, it's been the better part of 18 months now since you guys have done any acquisitions. You kind of implied -- so I guess I'll try to get you to state it outright. The PDP acquisitions feel a little bit too expensive to you still, and that's why you're looking at some more organic stuff?Kelly W. LoydWell, okay. So let's be clear, it was never either or, right? It was -- we were always going to look to have the potential for us to be able to put some money into the ground. And when there are years like this past year, when the criteria that we require to make sure that acquisitions are really highly accretive to us, just aren't there. I mean, just so you know, we use the same proven screening and processing and evaluation sort of process we have for years. We screened evaluated and even offered on many candidates.But like I said, the seller's expectations just weren't in line with what we require to make it a good acquisition for us. That strategy is -- has never gone away. We're still doing it as we speak, we're evaluating several deals. So that's something we very much still want to do, and we think this complements those very well and anyway. So I want to make sure I'm not leaving you with the impression this is all we're going to do. We -- our goal is to go find highly accretive PDP acquisitions as well.David LockeOkay. So -- go ahead, Ryan. I'm sorry.Ryan StashYes, I think it is fair to say that the acquisition market has been choppy maybe as a way to describe it. We look at -- we try to source deals through connections through negotiated and also through marketing processes. And there was probably a lull towards the beginning of this year of really quality deals that we saw come out. We have seen that pick up, to be honest. We have seen a lot more deals that might fit us pick up here in the near term. But there was a portion of -- we didn't just see as much deal flow as we would have liked to.J. Mark BunchAnd I'd like to follow up with what Ryan -- just kind of on top of that. We look at this as a way to flatten out our ads. I mean, it's a low-risk area. We know there's oil there. And the problem with acquisitions, if you just 100% rely on those, it tends to be kind of lumpy because they come kind of in groups -- and this way, it kind of helps flatten out our production profile as we go just because we're developing organically, we're not having to go out and bid for it every year.Ryan StashYes. I mean, when you're -- especially for the oil assets, right, if you're in a backward-dated commodity curve in oil, you'd much rather drill now to accelerate your cash flow then have to pay the sort of buy on a curve that's declining. It makes it a little bit easier and we'd rather accelerate that right now when we see those prices.J. Mark BunchYes. And with current prices, we would really love to drill these wells as soon as possible because, obviously, the prices have picked up lately.David LockeSo is stuff happening in the A&D market and you guys as -- I don't think I'd be insulting you by calling you value buyers just sort of aren't there. Is there still like a big differentiation between bid and ask and deals just aren't happening?Kelly W. LoydWell, it's a little early to say. So like I said, we haven't stopped that process. So I don't want to say too much because I don't know who's listening on the phone.J. Mark BunchNo, I would just say, we --Kelly W. LoydWe're excited about opportunities that are out there. We think the market has become a little more realistic from the seller's perspective. How about that?J. Mark BunchAnd we've actively gone after acquisitions. We had -- even while we were developing this Permian Basin opportunity, we were actively looking at other acquisitions and making offers on them. And I don't feel like we were like wildly out of the market. So I'd expect us to still be able to do those type of things too. We're just trying to like make it so we're not totally dependent upon acquisition work.David LockeOkay. And then we've talked on a couple prior conference calls about just like the general notion that growth CapEx would come from internal cash flow and acquisition probably gets funded through the credit facility to then be paid down over the course of the next couple of the -- couple following years. Does that -- is that still sort of like an accurate high-level description of the strategy?Kelly W. LoydYes. That's our base plan for sure. You are dead on.OperatorThe next question comes from Bruce Brown of Brown Capital.Bruce BrownAppreciate all the color you've given us. On the Podesco deal, how long have they been active in that field? And how many wells have they drilled? And what is their success rate been?J. Mark BunchThe timing of that, I'm not -- they started in, I think, 2019, maybe 2018.Kelly W. Loyd'18. But -- so what -- and look, it's a better question for PEDEVCO than for me. But the way we sort of characterize it they had sort of -- they had their generation 1, more science kind of wells where they were trying different landing zones, different frac sort of, I don't know, resins and different kind of sands in different ways and how the size of the customers are spacing between the clusters and trying different things, then they went on to what I would call their generation 2 sort of style of frac, which they tried and experimented with some of the things that worked and tried some more stuff to see if they could expand or is this going to work better or worse.And through that science that they did, they've come up with a plan and a style and a way to produce these that certainly they and we also think can be improved upon. But as a base case, we don't do any better than what we would call sort of the Gen 2 sort of completion design and where to land and all those sort of learnings that have been gained. I think we still have a very attractive return. But both they and we expect there to be plenty of room for upside, which, again, this isn't something we just walked into. This has been 4 months of detailed technical analysis and looking at all the science we can.And again, our staff in-house is -- has experience in this and is excellent at this. And we did a lot, as I think you even had an industry expert we consulted with. And so where we've become comfortable is what we know can be done, and we're also very -- very strong expectations that we'll beat that for -- anyway.Bruce BrownWell, so they're well up on the learning curve as you probably would put it. So they're at a point -- it sounds like they're at a point where perhaps they can maximize the knowledge they've accumulated and target -- their drilling targets would be more carefully planned and selected.Kelly W. LoydI think that one of the biggest learnings is really what zone you want to land the wells in. Like anywhere else, you're going to try, hey, maybe if we put it here, we might get 2 of the different San Andreas in interest pay zones, if we put it here, we get the -- and so they did all the right stuff you should do when you're trying to learn as much as you can.We walk away, again, we've learned a lot from that as obviously they have, and they have expectations and ideas and ways to move from that sort of Gen 2 as we call it, just sort of the Gen 3. There's been a whole lot of science and learnings. So, it's -- we're excited.J. Mark BunchJust so you know, yes, they've drilled 10 horizontal wells out there.Bruce BrownOkay. Yes. So the -- yes, exactly. So that's good. All right. Well, good luck with that whole process, it sounds very promising. The other question I had is, since we're almost done with the first fiscal quarter of fiscal '24, Oil prices have risen substantially during this period of time from where they ended the last quarter. And natural gas prices have -- appear to have improved some, but can you quantify what percentage impact -- what kind of range percentage impact that might have on your cash flow in the first quarter? I mean, just in a very broad sense.Ryan StashYes. So I mean, obviously, the challenge of being non-op is we're still delayed on getting actual prices in the field, which can sometimes differ than what we estimate. But if you're just looking -- and I'll talk on more on the gas side, right? The gas side was really some of the lowest prices that we've seen, right, quarter-over-quarter sequentially, right? So on the gas side, Q4 was a trough, right? And so if you look at what we've seen pricing for Houston Ship Channel is one of the pricing hubs that we sell our gas to Barnett and then Opal up in the Rockies.And so both of those indices are, on average, call it maybe $0.40 to $0.50 higher this quarter to date than they were last quarter. So I don't have the exact percentage, right, but you can -- but it's not a small percentage, right? That's a pretty material move if we're talking about $2 to $3 gas, the Barnett less than $2 gas last quarter, if you're adding -- if you're adding $0.40 onto that. So certainly, we expect to see some improvement this quarter on the gas realizations.Also NGLs, right? I talked about that earlier, but NGLs were kind of falling off a cliff, if you look at from April down to June, June being kind of the low month, they traded down quite a bit. Ethane itself is up 50%, 60% since last quarter. The Barnett has quite a bit of ethane. Some of the heavier components are up as much as anywhere from 5%, 10% to 30%, 40%. So overall, NGL prices, I think those are the 2 pieces you mentioned oil, but I think NGLs and natural gas or 2 or it might be more noticeable in realizations.Bruce BrownSure. That's -- yes, obviously, the bulk of your production is in those 2 areas. So, as a company -- yes, I understand. So that's great. Okay. I appreciate the color.OperatorThe next question comes from Joseph Crusty, a private investor.Unidentified ParticipantMy question is about the future development potential of the Delhi Field, assuming the acquisition of Denbury by ExxonMobil closes. Do you anticipate any positive operational changes in the development cycle of the field or changes in asset structure as a result of this transaction due to the size and scale of Exxon flowing through to the per barrel cost structure? Or is it too soon to begin thinking about this? And that's it.Kelly W. LoydI appreciate that. So yes, and that's a question we've had to think about. And I would just say one thing you need to know about Exxon is that they're not dumb. They're going to do the smart thing, they're going to do the right thing. So look, I would anticipate operations will be as good or better. I think Denbury has done a terrific job. I think Exxon has the scale and capability to do just as well and perhaps get prices even cheaper.One of the things we've been asked about in the past is the carbon capture permitting and all that and honestly, I still don't have any way to tell you whether Delhi will get that permit. So there could be some kind of benefit for that. But look, Denbury was planning on working on that and pushing towards it. And I would just suggest if Denbury can do it, I don't see why Exxon couldn't do it just as well, so.Ryan StashYes. I mean, the only I would add -- The only thing I would add is just the one thing we've had in the past with Denbury is capital constraints at Delhi. And so while we don't know what Exxon's plans are specifically for the field, the one thing Exxon is not is capital constrained, right? And so whereas Denbury went through bankruptcy, they went through a period of not spending much money at all, that shouldn't be an issue here from a capital perspective.Unidentified ParticipantI'm a very happy shareholder gentleman. Thanks for being such prudent stewards of capital.OperatorThe next question is a follow-up from Jeff Robertson of Water Tower Research.Jeffrey Woolf RobertsonThank you, Mark. As you -- or Kelly or Ryan. As you model the Permian wells, can you talk about what kind of impact you think those -- that asset could have on Evolution's realized oil price and also LOE?Kelly W. LoydI mean, Permian pricing this reviewers WCS sour, right?J. Mark BunchIt's about $3 deduct to --Kelly W. LoydWTIs.J. Mark BunchYes, it's about a $3 deduct to WTI, maybe a little bit more than that, $3 to $4. And I don't expect these will be particularly expensive to operate. So yes, you would expect -- I would expect that overall, the margin for the company would be better just because a lot of the other stuff we have is either water flooded or CO2 flooded, which typically is low margin -- is a lower margin type of operation. So yes, I would think the margins would improve.Kelly W. LoydI definitely think -- I mean, the work we've done, it certainly stacks up to be a fairly high margin, low-cost operating-wise oil play.J. Mark BunchWell, and it's like whenever you have new wells, you're drilling new wells, are going to be higher rate wells, and that typically translates into higher margins.OperatorThe next question comes from John Bair of Ascend Will Advisors.John H. BairJust to be clear, a real simple question. I guess as you move forward to develop the drill, the 3-well pad and your other operations, all that should be paid for through cash flow. Is that correct? In other words, you've ended the quarter and the year debt-free with cash on the books and so forth. So I'm just kind of curious if I'm reading this right or hearing this correctly.Ryan StashYes, John, that's the plan. Obviously, pricing aside, but where prices are right now in the forward market and where we expect, yes, we would plan -- and it's always our goal to drill those out of cash flow, right? We wouldn't (inaudible) additional funding to drill those.John H. BairRight. So your other operations, other fields and so forth. So I'm just -- I'm a little -- I guess I'm a little stunned at the reaction today and obviously, a lot of questions about and I think inferring that the dividend payment might be in jeopardy and yet you've confirmed the $0.12 and have long made that a very priority. And so I'm just -- I'm a little baffled at the extent of the reaction that's gone on here today. And I don't know if you would care to comment on that at all or?Kelly W. LoydOkay. So here's our goal. We're going to make sure we do everything we can to make everyone who sold regret it and buy it back. How about that?John H. BairRight. Understood. Did you do any stock buyback in the last quarter at all?John Marshall WhiteWe obviously come out with our 10-K later to confirm that. But the stock buybacks were honestly really limited for the prior -- we did a lot more or let's just say that in the March quarter that we already published. We'll publish on our 10-K after the call today.John H. BairWell, I would echo the previous -- one of the previous commentators that been pleased with how you've moved forward. And I hope that you do prove everybody that have been dumping this thing today in error. So keep on doing what you're doing.Kelly W. LoydThanks for the sentiment. And look, as you know, and I think it's pretty obvious. We run this company for the long run, and we think about things with multiyear horizons. So while nobody likes to see what's going on in the stock market today with our stock, we're not going to let that make us make any rash decisions. We're always going to do what's in the best interest for our shareholders in the long run, so.OperatorThe next question is a follow-up from David Logoff of Old Mammoth Investments.David LockeIs there a way to do sort of like a quick recap for civilians of what went haywire in California last year, at least as it regarded the prices that you got in Jonah and what you're sort of thinking the situation looks like over the course of the next 9 months?Ryan StashI wish I had that crystal ball going forward. But -- and going past, if you recall, so last winter was unusually -- I wouldn't say unusually but probably more -- colder than the normal, right? If you look at sort of the weather maps on the West Coast and California, a lot due to La Nina. So the issue you have in California is very, very little natural gas storage, and so they have to buy everything on the spot market. And when cold weather strikes, people will pay what they need to get the gas to heat their homes, right? And they can't pull it out of storage. And so you tend to get these really high prices and spikes out there, not unlike we've seen right in the power market in Texas when you've had heatwaves, you get that in California during the wintertime.Now interestingly, we saw that in the summer a little bit too, where we saw prices in July and August spike a little bit with the heat out there, too. So any time there's a power demand, whether it's to cool your home or heat your home, you're going to see probably spikes. If you look out in the forward curve, it depends on the day, but this winter, we last time I looked, you could hedge prices for probably around $3 premium to Henry Hub. It may have gone down a little bit here in the last couple of days, but call it $2.50, $3, maybe even as much as $4 premium hedging in the forward market right now for winter out in California. So I think the market is still sort of expecting to potentially be short barrels out there.If we saw an unusually warm winter in California, then we might not quite see the demand that we've seen in the past winters. But historically, we have seen at least some pump over the winter months. And I'll also say, I think I've talked about this before, we sell gas since we take our gas in kind in Jonah and we market it ourselves, we sell it on kind of seasonal contracts, so winter and summer contracts. And winter contracts, we get a pretty healthy premium even to what you can sell at Northwest Pipeline or Opal. So we would also expect that premium coming up this winter.David LockeOkay. So you're sort of -- you're kind of hedging but not -- but not like in the futures market per se, just given the nature of the way you're contracting works?Ryan StashThat's right. So yes, so we basically sell as much gas as we're comfortable selling firm, if you will, in the wintertime at a fixed price Northwest pipeline. It's first a month Northwest pipeline plus spread, right, which I would tell you in the winter time is a fairly healthy spread. And so we do have a physical contract. Like you said, it's not really hedged. We're subject to the movements of Northwest Pipeline, but we get a premium to whatever that price is during the winter.Kelly W. LoydBut to be clear, we locked in the premium we're going to get, not the base price.David LockeAnd then sort of cycling back to capital allocation a little bit and acknowledging what's going on with the stock price this afternoon, because low 6s looks an awful lot different than high 9s. How do you guys think about stock buybacks? Where would the capital come from for a stock buyback to the extent that you now have functionally committed a fair amount of cash flow to the Permian assets?Kelly W. LoydWell, it's -- it would -- again, it would compete for dollars. So again, everything is on the table at all times. And again, we are very excited to be in this in this drilling partnership, and we want to go forward with it. But our priorities are going to be the best use of every dollar. So that -- everything is fair there, so.Ryan StashYes, I think the way we might think about it, and obviously, we -- the Board has authorized sort of the overall share buyback plan, but we do authorize -- generally, we enter into 10b5-1s, right, on kind of a quarterly basis. But I think as we think about capital allocation, I think if you saw -- obviously, the dividend we've now said is very important, which we've always said, and we've said it at $0.12. And so the dividend, obviously, is a base dividend we're certainly going to pay.Above that and above any capital from the PEDEVCO Permian asset or any other asset, if we saw more outperformance in commodity prices with excess cash flow, especially if our stock stayed, as you mentioned low 6s versus high 9s, there might be a reason for us to take another hard look at possibly buying some shares back with sort of outperformance or excess cash flow. If that makes sense.OperatorThis concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Kelly Loyd for any closing remarks.Kelly W. LoydJust quickly, I want to thank everyone for taking the time. As you know, we are always here to answer questions. So anyway, I appreciate your interest and your time. Thank you.OperatorThe conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation, and you may now disconnect."

2023-09-21,"Key InsightsCulp's Annual General Meeting to take place on 27th of SeptemberSalary of US$500.0k is part of CEO Robert Culp's total remunerationThe total compensation is similar to the average for the industryCulp's three-year loss to shareholders was 53% while its EPS was down 52% over the past three years Culp, Inc. (NYSE:CULP) has not performed well recently and CEO Robert Culp will probably need to up their game. At the upcoming AGM on 27th of September, shareholders can hear from the board including their plans for turning around performance. They will also get a chance to influence managerial decision-making through voting on resolutions such as executive remuneration, which may impact firm value in the future. From our analysis, we think CEO compensation may need a review in light of the recent performance. View our latest analysis for Culp Comparing Culp, Inc.'s CEO Compensation With The IndustryAccording to our data, Culp, Inc. has a market capitalization of US$70m, and paid its CEO total annual compensation worth US$1.2m over the year to April 2023. We note that's an increase of 13% above last year. We think total compensation is more important but our data shows that the CEO salary is lower, at US$500k.In comparison with other companies in the American Luxury industry with market capitalizations under US$200m, the reported median total CEO compensation was US$1.2m. From this we gather that Robert Culp is paid around the median for CEOs in the industry. Moreover, Robert Culp also holds US$1.8m worth of Culp stock directly under their own name, which reveals to us that they have a significant personal stake in the company.Component20232022Proportion (2023)SalaryUS$500kUS$482k41%OtherUS$723kUS$603k59%Total CompensationUS$1.2mUS$1.1m100%Talking in terms of the industry, salary represented approximately 24% of total compensation out of all the companies we analyzed, while other remuneration made up 76% of the pie. It's interesting to note that Culp pays out a greater portion of remuneration through salary, compared to the industry. If total compensation is slanted towards non-salary benefits, it indicates that CEO pay is linked to company performance.Story continuesceo-compensationCulp, Inc.'s GrowthOver the last three years, Culp, Inc. has shrunk its earnings per share by 52% per year. Its revenue is down 17% over the previous year.Few shareholders would be pleased to read that EPS have declined. And the fact that revenue is down year on year arguably paints an ugly picture. It's hard to argue the company is firing on all cylinders, so shareholders might be averse to high CEO remuneration. Looking ahead, you might want to check this free visual report on analyst forecasts for the company's future earnings..Has Culp, Inc. Been A Good Investment?With a total shareholder return of -53% over three years, Culp, Inc. shareholders would by and large be disappointed. This suggests it would be unwise for the company to pay the CEO too generously.In Summary...Not only have shareholders not seen a favorable return on their investment, but the business hasn't performed well either. Few shareholders would be willing to award the CEO with a pay raise. At the upcoming AGM, the board will get the chance to explain the steps it plans to take to improve business performance.While CEO pay is an important factor to be aware of, there are other areas that investors should be mindful of as well. We've identified 1 warning sign for Culp that investors should be aware of in a dynamic business environment.Important note: Culp is an exciting stock, but we understand investors may be looking for an unencumbered balance sheet and blockbuster returns.

2023-09-25,"Nobody makes enemies like Donald Trump, and his 2024 presidential election campaign promises some interesting new ones. The most recent: electric vehicles.Trump is wading into the auto workers strike by claiming that EVs threaten blue collar livelihoods. That’s a clear attack on President Biden, who wants to slash carbon emissions by boosting EVs to 50% of new car sales by 2030, from about 7% today. Electric vehicles don’t burn fossil fuels and have no tailpipe emissions, so they help address global warming, as long as the electricity that powers them is relatively clean.Trump has begun calling Biden’s plan a “ridiculous all-electric car hoax,” and he blames the United Auto Workers (UAW) leadership for complicity in the scheme. He claims “all of these cars are going to be made in China,” which, if true, would destroy auto worker jobs in the United States.The solution? Elect Trump, of course.The EV attack is a classic Trump tactic: Conflate a real issue with a phony one and embellish the whole thing to the point of absurdity.The real issue is the auto workers’ quest for better pay, benefits, and job security. Unions have been in steady decline for decades and auto workers want assurances from General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis that they’ll be able to support their families well into the future.The phony issue is the “EV hoax.” EVs are no hoax. Tesla proves that. Tesla has become the world’s most profitable automaker — and a moonshot stock — by putting 4.5 million electric cars on the road and winning rave reviews from buyers. Many automakers now emulate the upstart Tesla, instead of the other way around, because they think Tesla has identified the future of transportation.[Drop Rick Newman a note, follow him on Twitter, or sign up for his newsletter.]The absurd embellishment is Trump’s claim about all the EVs coming from China. Trump himself took steps to prevent that when he was president, by imposing new tariffs on Chinese imports. The Trump tariffs are still there. If China starts importing cars to the United States, it’s a sign that Trump’s own trade policy failed.Story continuesTrump plans a prime time address to striking auto workers in Michigan on Sept. 27, which will be a test of whether his EV onslaught gets any traction. The UAW endorsed Biden in 2020, and will almost certainly endorse him again in 2024. Trump is clearly trying to roil the union leadership, while lobbying for blue collar votes in crucial swing states such as Michigan and Wisconsin.Biden has his own pitch to those workers. Last year, he signed into law powerful new incentives to build EVs and other green energy components in the United States. The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act included valuable tax breaks for companies that build US factories and hire American workers, including unionized ones.Former President Donald Trump speaks during a commit to caucus rally, Wednesday, Sept. 20, 2023, in Maquoketa, Iowa. (Charlie Neibergall/AP Photo) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)The law is already having a pronounced effect. An unprecedented boom in factory construction is underway, directly linked to the new tax breaks. Manufacturing employment seems sure to rise once those plants come online. Biden may have gotten much more than he bargained for in the IRA. When Congress passed the law last year, budget analysts estimated the green energy tax breaks would cost around $385 billion during the next 10 years. But companies have applied for the tax breaks at a much faster pace than expected, and the 10-year cost now looks to be around $1.2 trillion.Instead of green energy jobs going overseas, foreign firms are coming to the United States, to partner with American companies and build EV battery plants here. The most likely problem isn’t disappearing jobs, it’s a lack of skilled workers to run all the new factories.Auto workers have one legitimate concern about electric vehicles. They have fewer parts than gas-powered cars and require fewer workers to build. That’s an issue in the strike. But the union’s real worry isn’t a lack of jobs — it’s that many of the new green energy jobs won’t be unionized. Tax breaks in the IRA are generally larger for companies that pay union-level wages, but many companies may opt for smaller tax breaks and non-unionized workers.Other peculiar battle lines seem to be forming. The one person who could rebut Trump’s “EV hoax” with bulletproof authority is Telsa CEO Elon Musk, who has become the world’s richest non-kleptocrat by selling EVs. Musk is Trumpy himself, and he reactivated Trump’s banned Twitter account after buying the social media platform last year. So Musk would have credibility in Trumpworld if he said, ""Sorry Don, EVs are the real deal.""But Musk may not want to defang Trump. Musk loathes unions and may enjoy the spectacle of Trump trying to pit union workers against their leaders. Musk also has a beef with Biden, whom he called a “damp sock puppet” last year, because Biden talks up unionized Detroit automakers while mostly ignoring non-unionized Tesla. Trump is the enemy of not one, but two of Musk’s own enemies, which could make him doubly useful to Musk.Contrary to what Trump says, electric vehicles are increasingly affordable, pragmatic, and economically viable as a business. While not a panacea, they help cut carbon emissions and contain global warming. For people who don’t want an EV, gas-powered cars will still be available for years and probably decades. Biden’s policies are speeding the transition to greener cars, but not killing the traditional car business.Trump’s propaganda succeeds, however, when the facts are a little bit complicated and a few misleading claims can leave voters confused. He’s now employing that formula to vilify EVs and their big champion, Biden. EVs are here to stay, but they’re now politicized like seemingly everything else in America.Rick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

2023-09-26,"A potential major step toward treating stress-related neuro-psychiatric disordersNEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / September 26, 2023 / Today, Protagenic Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:PTIX), a pioneering biopharmaceutical company, has announced the commencement of its Phase I/IIa clinical trial for PT00114, its leading drug candidate.Key Highlights:Clinical Trial Focus: The trial aims to evaluate the therapeutic potential of PT00114, a synthetic version of the naturally occurring brain peptide TCAP, in treating an array of neuro-psychiatric conditions, including depression, anxiety, and PTSD. PT00114 is a novel first in class peptide which has shown profound activity with a novel mechanism in disease models of those three conditions, as well as in treating models of addiction withdrawal.Study Design: Phase I will recruit 56 subjects, randomized to undergo subcutaneous injections of either PT00114 or a placebo. The Phase I/IIa study will assess both healthy volunteers and patients diagnosed with Treatment-Resistant Depression, PTSD, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder.Progress Indicators: Besides monitoring disease status, the trial will gauge disease response by measuring biomarkers, such as circulating cortisol levels before and after treatment.Partnership: Axiom Real-Time Metrics, a CRO/Data Analytics firm with over 1,000 clinical trials to its credit, is managing the clinical program.Expert Insights:Dr. Maurizio Fava, Psychiatrist-in-Chief in the Department of Psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), Associate Dean for Clinical & Translational Research, Slater Family Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, and an international leader in depression, who is serving as principal investigator in Protagenic's Phase I/IIa clinical trial, commented, ""Stress related disorders are at an all-time high and I am excited by the possibility of a novel mechanism which may help a population of patients greatly in need of new therapeutics.""Story continuesCompany Focus:Robert B. Stein, MD, PhD, Chief Medical Officer of Protagenic Therapeutics, remarked, ""Unlike benzodiazepines like Valium and Xanax, PT00114 allows appropriate responses to environmental stressors but prevents ‘deer in the headlights' overshoot. Stress is a driver of many neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions. The pre-clinical pharmacology of PT00114 has been extremely promising.""About Protagenic Therapeutics, Inc.

Among the various amendments to the prior agreement as set forth in the 1st amendment (as described in greater detail in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 28, 2023), the prior agreement was amended: 1) to extend the required closing date thereof; and 2) to modify financial closing terms of the previously announced definitive agreement.The modification to the financial closing terms allows for the use of up to $20 million of cash-on-hand of MeridianBet Group to pay a portion of the $30 million cash payable by Golden Matrix at the closing of the transaction, to the extent approved in the sole discretion of the sellers.Subsequently, on September 29, 2023, Golden Matrix filed a Current Report on Form 8-K, disclosing excerpts from certain presentations used by GMGI in connection with the funding sought by Golden Matrix to close the transaction.“These recent filings reinforce the importance of this strategic acquisition, and demonstrate both companies’ willingness and ability to close the transaction,” said GMGI CEO, Anthony Brian Goodman, who continued, “The amendment allowing GMGI and the sellers to use up to $20 million of the MeridianBet Group’s cash-on-hand at closing (subject to the sole discretion of the sellers), not only provides the Company with potential greater flexibility on financing, but we believe also demonstrates the sellers’ confidence in the value of creating a combined entity capable of being greater than the sum of its parts.”Story continuesMr. Goodman noted that the MeridianBet Group has increased its year-to-date revenues considerably against last year’s revenues; and the proforma performance of the combined company, following the acquisition, is now projected to be approximately $132 million in revenues and $27 million in Adjusted EBITDA, for the October 31, 2023 fiscal year.“Both MeridianBet Group CEO, Zoran Milosevic, and I are confident that the completion of this acquisition will drive long-term value for all our stakeholders as we seek to benefit from economies of scale and both companies’ historical revenue and profit growth. We are also working closely with our bankers in an effort to raise the most beneficial financing available for the transaction,” concluded Mr. Goodman.Golden Matrix expects to file the required proxy statement requesting shareholder approval for the issuance of the shares of common stock issuable in connection with the transaction, and other matters, with the SEC for shareholder approval very soon.The acquisition is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2023 or first quarter of 2024, subject to customary conditions to closing including, but not limited to GMGI shareholder approval, and Nasdaq approval, to the extent required, and other items.For additional information regarding the purchase agreement, as amended, and the terms of the 1st amendment, including a breakdown of all of the consideration payable thereunder, please refer to Golden Matrix’s Current Report on Form 8-K, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 28, 2023 and is available at www.sec.govAbout MeridianBet GroupFounded in 2001, the MeridianBet Group is a well-established online sports betting and gaming group, licensed and currently operating in 15 jurisdictions across Europe, Africa and South America.

Other unknown or unpredictable factors also could have material adverse effects on the Company’s future results. The forward-looking statements included in this press release are made only as of the date hereof. The Company cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.

If we update one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be drawn that we will make additional updates with respect to those or other forward-looking statements.ProjectionsThe financial projections (the “Projections”) included herein were prepared by GMGI in good faith using assumptions believed to be reasonable. A significant number of assumptions about the operations of the business of GMGI were based, in part, on economic, competitive, and general business conditions prevailing at the time the Projections were developed. Any future changes in these conditions, may materially impact the ability of GMGI to achieve the financial results set forth in the Projections. The Projections are based on numerous assumptions, including realization of the operating strategy of GMGI; industry performance; no material adverse changes in applicable legislation or regulations, or the administration thereof, or generally accepted accounting principles; general business and economic conditions; competition; retention of key management and other key employees; absence of material contingent or unliquidated litigation, indemnity, or other claims; and other matters, many of which will be beyond the control of GMGI, and some or all of which may not materialize. Additionally, to the extent that the assumptions inherent in the Projections are based upon future business decisions and objectives, they are subject to change. Although the Projections are presented with numerical specificity and are based on reasonable expectations developed by GMGI’s management, the assumptions and estimates underlying the Projections are subject to significant business, economic, and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which will be beyond the control of GMGI. Accordingly, the Projections are only estimates and are necessarily speculative in nature. It is expected that some or all of the assumptions in the Projections will not be realized and that actual results will vary from the Projections. Such variations may be material and may increase over time. In light of the foregoing, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the Projections. The projected financial information contained herein should not be regarded as a representation or warranty by GMGI, its management, advisors, or any other person that the Projections can or will be achieved. GMGI cautions that the Projections are speculative in nature and based upon subjective decisions and assumptions. As a result, the Projections should not be relied on as necessarily predictive of actual future events.The Projections include certain measures not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). Specifically, the Projections include an estimate of combined company Adjusted EBITDA, which is defined as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation. Such Non-GAAP financial measure has not been reconciled to the comparable GAAP financial measure because the reconciliation could not be performed without unreasonable efforts. Specifically, the GAAP measures are not accessible on a forward-looking basis because we are currently unable to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the type and extent of certain items that would be expected to impact the GAAP measures for the combined company. The unavailable information could have a significant impact on our GAAP financial results.Additional Information and Where to Find ItThis communication does not constitute a solicitation of any vote, proxy or approval in connection with the Purchase Agreement or related transactions.

2023-10-07,"Virco Mfg (NASDAQ:VIRC) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 83% over the last three months. Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. Specifically, we decided to study Virco Mfg's  ROE in this article.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. Check out our latest analysis for Virco Mfg How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Virco Mfg is:32% = US$26m ÷ US$82m (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2023).The 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.32.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.A Side By Side comparison of Virco Mfg's Earnings Growth And 32% ROEFirstly, we acknowledge that Virco Mfg has a significantly high ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 8.6% which is quite remarkable. As a result, Virco Mfg's exceptional 34% net income growth seen over the past five years, doesn't come as a surprise.Story continuesWe then compared Virco Mfg's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 9.1% in the same 5-year period.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. If you're wondering about Virco Mfg's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.Is Virco Mfg Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Virco Mfg doesn't pay any dividend to its shareholders, meaning that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This is likely what's driving the high earnings growth number discussed above.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that Virco Mfg's performance has been quite good. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. That being so, according to the latest industry analyst forecasts, the company's earnings are expected to shrink in the future.

(Nasdaq:PIXY) (""ShiftPixy"" or the ""Company""), a Florida-based national staffing enterprise which designs, manages, and sells access to a disruptive, revolutionary platform that facilitates employment in the rapidly growing Gig Economy. Co-Founder and CEO of the Company, Scott Absher, joined Stock Day host Matthew Dunehoo.Dunehoo began the interview by asking about the Company's background and current projects. Absher elaborated on the technology available for the part-time employment industry, including workers compensation insurance and time management. ""We set out to take everything that we knew about managing human capital and develop and deliver it on a very mobilized platform,"" shared Absher. ""It was obvious that all of the emerging new gig platforms had actually created an excessive amount of turnover,"" he explained. ""We developed the ShiftPixy platform to re-engage and reconnect with the newworkforce, while also making it easier for brick and mortars to create opportunities between the two.""""How are you getting the word out to brick and mortar businesses about this product?"", asked Absher. ""The legacy part of our business was focused on restaurant operators, so we directly marketed with franchisees of all of the major brands,"" said Absher. ""We have also spent a lot of time working with industrial staffing companies, medical staffing companies, and technology staffing companies,"" he shared. ""We are now looking at acquiring several of these companies to create our own national footprint.""The conversation then turned to the Company's recent announcements regarding AI integration for the ShiftPixy platform. ""AI has been in our tech stack since 2017,"" said Absher. ""Our first use for AI was in the onboarding process,"" he explained, adding that the ShiftPixy platform allows new employees to complete the onboarding process quickly and more efficiently. ""We power this technology with IBM's Watson.""Story continuesAbsher then elaborated on additional AI applications for the ShiftPixy platform. ""We decided to take the Instant Interview approach to allow people to use their smartphones and run through a video selfie where they answer five to six questions to be passed on to the hiring manager,"" continued Absher. ""All of the processes that would normally be done manually by a group of recruiters or staff members are now all being done through AI.""""AI can be used to accelerate processes, accelerate engagement, thrill customers, and better engage employees, and I believe we are on one of those transformation horizons here with that technology,"" said Absher.Dunehoo then asked about a recent announcement detailing the Company's reverse split effective date delay. ""We have been in the process of conducting a reverse stock split as we recapitalize the company,"" said Absher. ""I have never sold a share of the company, however I have donated my shares a couple of times to charity,"" said Absher, adding that he recently donated shares to satisfy the Company's outstanding shares issue. ""A couple of the charities were slow to move the stock, so Nasdaq asked us to bump our reverse stock out a couple of weeks.""""Are there any forthcoming, noteworthy catalysts?"", asked Dunehoo. ""We have been so immersed in the industrial human capital space,"" said Absher. ""We have three Letters of Intent with companies that are moving towards definitive agreements and we are wrapping up financial diligence on those,"" he explained. ""We have also been busy putting together an extremely large debt facility that will allow us to acquire these companies,"" he added. ""The plan is to start and close our first one in October, which will put us on pace to close one deal per month through 2024.""To close the interview, Absher encouraged listeners and shareholders to keep up-to-date on the Company's current and upcoming interviews as they continue to expand in their revolutionary employment platform.To hear entire the interview with Scott Absher, follow the link to the podcast here: https://audioboom.com/posts/8381314-shiftpixy-discusses-revolutionary-employment-platform-for-the-rapidly-growing-gig-economy-with-thInvestors.

2023-10-12,"Nogin, Inc.Findings show the need for personalization in retailTUSTIN, Calif., Oct. 12, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Nogin (Nasdaq: NOGN), a pioneer in Commerce-as-a-Service (""CaaS""), today announced the results of its survey examining online shopping trends and preferences. The survey, conducted online by The Harris Poll on behalf of Nogin, polled over 2,000 U.S. adults aged 18 and older. The survey shows that a significant majority of Americans are active online shoppers with 96% having made online purchases in the past year, and 26% having made an online purchase in the past 24 hours. The data underscores the importance of various incentives in driving online purchases, with free shipping (81%) and discounts (68%) topping the list of what inspires online shoppers to make purchases. The findings also highlight the growing significance of personalized experiences, with 20% of online shoppers saying they are inspired by personalized promotional emails and 17% by personalized brand recommendations.The survey results suggest a notable shift in the ecommerce landscape. Traditional incentives such as free shipping and discounts continue to play a significant role in consumer purchasing decisions. However, the data also points to a rising preference among consumers for more personalized shopping experiences. In response to these evolving consumer preferences, retailers should consider enhancing their ecommerce capabilities and focusing on personalization to provide more individualized and engaging customer journeys. With the holiday season approaching, adapting strategies to align with diverse consumer needs could be pivotal for direct-to-consumer (D2C) retailers.“As we approach the holiday season, the data underscores the need for retailers to provide online consumers with the right mix of incentives and personalized experiences,” said Jonathan Huberman, CEO at Nogin. “For D2C brands, this translates to a golden opportunity: optimizing their ecommerce approach using intelligent, AI-driven strategies that cater to individual shopper preferences. By doing so, they can not only boost sales, but also cultivate enduring customer relationships that thrive well beyond the holiday frenzy.”Story continuesInsights into online shoppers’ attitudes and behaviors include:Personalized experiences matter to consumers and help drive buying behavior. Among online shoppers, 20% report that receiving personalized promotional emails serves as a compelling motivator for making a purchase, while 17% find themselves swayed by personalized brand recommendations. The survey found that, among online shoppers, men are more likely than women to be inspired to make an online purchase based on personalized recommendations from a brand (19% vs. 14%). Meanwhile, younger online shoppers are more likely to be influenced by personalized recommendations than their older counterparts (22% of 18-44-year-olds, compared to 12% for 45+).Social media is the new storefront as online shoppers of all ages make purchases through social ads. 70% of online shoppers say they make purchases directly through social media ads, with 29% of those who make purchases through social media ads saying they are making more purchases that way this year than they did last year. This rise in social shopping may be tied to how much time consumers spend on social media platforms, or it may be because social algorithms deliver personalized recommendations that resonate more strongly with shoppers. In any case, social shopping is prevalent among all age groups, including more than half (56%) of online shoppers aged 65+ who have made purchases through social media ads. Among those who make purchases directly through social media ads, those ages 18-44 are more likely than those ages 45+ to say they made more purchases through social media ads this year compared to last year (36% vs. 22%).Free shipping is the top incentive that inspires online purchases. Free shipping (81%) and discounts (68%) top the list of things online shoppers say would inspire them to purchase online. What’s more, more online shoppers would be inspired to make an online purchase if free shipping is offered (81%) than if free returns are available (48%). For many shoppers, offering free shipping could be just the “nudge” needed to encourage buying behavior.Lack of integrated payments, high shipping costs and difficult return policies are likely to cause an online shopper to abandon a purchase. More than 3 in 4 online shoppers (78%) say high shipping costs would make them likely to abandon an online order (78%), followed by difficult return policies (44%). Meanwhile, almost 1 in 4 online shoppers (23%) say not having integrated payments at checkout would increase their likelihood to abandon their online purchase. However, the impact of purchase abandonment due to the lack of integrated payment offerings and buy now, pay later (BNPL) options varies by age: Online shoppers ages 18-34 are twice as likely as those ages 35+ to say not having integrated payments at checkout would increase their likelihood to abandon their online purchase (36% vs. 18%). With regard to BNPL, online shoppers ages 18-44 are more likely than those ages 45+ to say not having the option to pay with BNPL services would increase their likelihood to abandon their online purchase (18% vs. 7%).Survey Methodology:This survey was conducted online within the United States by The Harris Poll on behalf of Nogin from August 29-31, 2023, among 2,041 adults ages 18 and older, of whom 1,973 are online shoppers (i.e., have made a purchase online in the past year). The sampling precision of Harris online polls is measured by using a Bayesian credible interval. For this study, the sample data is accurate to within +/- 2.7 percentage points using a 95% confidence level.

2023-10-20,"Heritage Financial Corporation (NASDAQ:HFWA) Q3 2023 Earnings Call Transcript October 19, 2023Heritage Financial Corporation beats earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $0.51, expectations were $0.44.Operator: Thank you all for joining. I would like to welcome you all to the Heritage Financial Corporation Q3 2023 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Brika, and I'll be your moderator for today's call. All lines are on mute for the presentation portion of the call, with an opportunity for questions-and-answers at the end. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to pass the conference over to your host, Jeff Deuel, CEO of Heritage Financial to begin. So Jeff, please go ahead.Jeffrey Deuel: Thank you, Brika. Welcome, and good morning to everyone who called in. And for those who may listen later, this is Jeff Deuel, CEO of Heritage Financial. Attending with me are Bryan McDonald, President and Chief Operating Officer; Don Hinson, Chief Financial Officer; and Tony Chalfant, Chief Credit Officer. Our third quarter earnings release went out this morning premarket, and hopefully, you have had the opportunity to review it prior to the call. We have also posted an updated third quarter investor presentation on the Investor Relations portion of our corporate website, which includes more detail on our deposits, loan portfolio, liquidity and credit quality. We will reference the presentation during the call.Please refer to the forward-looking statements in the press release. We're pleased to report another solid quarter with earnings per share exceeding consensus. This quarter's performance was enhanced by loan recoveries. These recoveries are further evidence of our strong risk management practices and how they continue to benefit us. We continue to see pressure on deposit pricing in Q3, which is impacting our net interest margin. Deposit balances stabilized in Q3, although the mix of deposits continue to partially shift into higher rate products. As expected, due mostly to the rate environment, loan growth slowed in Q3 compared to the first two quarters of the year, although year-to-date, we are still reporting low single-digit loan growth. Overall, we continue to focus on growing a strong balance sheet with ample liquidity and capital that, will serve us well in the present and in the future.Story continuesWe will now move to Don, who will take a few minutes to cover our financial results.Donald Hinson: Thank you, Jeff. I will be reviewing some of the main drivers of our performance for Q3. As I walk through our financial results, unless otherwise noted, all of the prior period comparisons will be with the second quarter of 2023. Starting with the balance sheet. Loan growth slowed in Q3, increasing $15.5 million for the quarter. Year-to-date loan growth through Q3 is at 5.3%. Yields on the loan portfolio were 5.30% for the quarter, which was 11 basis points higher than Q2 and contributed to a 12 basis point increase in yield earning assets. Bryan McDonald will have an update on loan production and yields in a few minutes. Unlike the declines over the past few quarters. Total deposits increased $39.6 million during the quarter, the increase is due substantially to higher CD balances, as customers continue to take advantage of the higher rate environment by lowering their excess balances and lower paying non-maturity deposit accounts.These factors contributed to an increase of 31 basis points in our cost of interest-bearing deposits to 1.23% for Q3. Also impacting total deposit balances in Q3 was the sale of our Ellensburg branch along with its $14.7 million of deposits as well as an increase of $62.8 million in brokered CDs during the quarter. Due to the current market pressure related to deposit rates, we expect to continue to experience an increase in the cost of our core deposits, although at a slower pace. This is illustrated by the cost of our interest-bearing deposits being 1.35% for the month of September with a spot rate of 1.38% as of September 30. Investment balances decreased $136 million during Q3 due to higher-than-normal maturities and prepayments during the quarter, as well as the sale of $47 million of securities.These sales in combination with the purchase of $23 million of higher earnings securities, was done to partially restructure the portfolio while also increasing our cash position. A loss of $1.9 million was recognized on these sales in Q3, most of which occurred in September. It is estimated that the annualized income improvement, from these transactions will be $1.4 million, resulting in an earn-back period of 1.4 years. We will consider additional loss trades in order to continue, to defend our margin from downward pressures. Moving on to the income statement. Net interest income decreased $206,000 due to a decrease in net interest margin, partially offset by an increase in average earning assets. The NIM decreased to 3.47% for Q3 from 3.56% in the prior quarter.The decrease in NIM was primarily due to the cost of interest-bearing deposits, increasing more rapidly than the yields on earning assets. We expect NIM to decrease further in Q4 since the NIM for the month of September was five basis points lower than it was for the quarter. The pace and duration of our decrease in margin will be highly dependent on continued increases in our cost of interest-bearing deposits, as well as maintaining deposit balances. As our cost deposits as well as deposit balances level off, we expect to experience margin stabilization due to the repricing of adjustable rate loans in addition to higher origination rates on new loans. We recognized a reversal of provision for credit losses in the amount of $878,000 during Q3 versus a provision expense of $1.9 million in Q2.The reversal of provision expense was due to net recoveries of $1.2 million recognized during the quarter. Tony will provide more information on these recoveries in a few minutes. Non-interest income decreased $1 million from the prior quarter, primarily due to the loss on the sale of securities previously mentioned, partially offset by a gain of $610,000 on the sale of our Ellensburg branch that I discussed earlier. Non-interest expense decreased to $355,000 to approximately $41 million in Q3. This was due to decreases in numerous categories, partially offset by an increase in compensation and benefits. Compensation expense was higher compared to Q2 due to the adjustments we've made to the accrual for incentive-based compensation in Q2. All of our regulatory capital ratios remain comfortably above well-capitalized thresholds and our TCE ratio is at 8.2%, down slightly from the prior quarter due primarily to AOCI.In addition, with a loan deposit ratio of approximately 76% and cash balances over $200 million, we have plenty of liquidity to keep - to grow our loan portfolio. I will now pass the call to Tony, who will have an update on our credit quality metrics.Anthony Chalfant: Thank you, Don. I'm pleased to report that credit quality remained strong and stable through, the first nine months of the year. As of quarter end, nonaccrual loans totaled just over $3 million, and we did not hold any OREO. This represents 0.07% of total loans as, compared to 0.11% at the end of the second quarter. Nonaccrual loans declined by $1.6 million, during the quarter and are now down by 51% over the last 12 months. Reductions of just over $2 million were largely tied to the payoff of an agricultural loan that, was the culmination of a long-term workout. Partially offsetting the reduction was the movement of three C&I relationships, to nonaccrual status in the aggregate amount of $440,000. Page 25 of the investor presentation reflects the significant improvement, we've experienced in our nonaccrual loans since the end of 2020.This quarter, we began including loans over 90 days past due and still accruing interest in our nonperforming assets total. This total includes three loans that are well secured by commercial real estate, at low loan-to-value ratios and are in the process of collection. They remain on accrual status, because the risk of loss is very low. Criticized loans, those risk-weighted special mention and substandard totaled just under $135 million at the end of the quarter. This is a decrease of $8.5 million or 6% from the end of the second quarter. Criticized loans are virtually unchanged since the end of 2022. Within that group, loans rated substandard remained stable and are actually down by $3 million over that same time period. Overall, our commercial real estate portfolio continues to perform well and has been stable, through the first nine months of the year.An experienced banker offering financial advice to a young couple. Editorial photo for a financial news article. 8k. --ar 16:9Total criticized CRE loans represent 3.1% of our total CRE portfolio and 2.2%, of our entire loan portfolio. While we continue to closely watch our portfolio of office loans, we have yet to see any material deterioration in credit quality. At quarter end, criticized office loans totaled approximately $21.5 million which is down from the $25 million reported at the end of the second quarter. This represents 3.8% of our total portfolio of owner and nonowner-occupied office loans. In summary, we believe our office CRE portfolio is conservatively underwritten very granular and not materially exposed to the high risk of the central business district areas. Page 24 of the investor presentation provides more detailed information about our office loan portfolio.During the third quarter, we had a large recovery on the payoff of the agricultural loan that I mentioned earlier. This represented the majority of the $1.3 million in total recoveries and was partially offset, by charge-offs of $138,000, resulting in a net recovery of just under $1.2 million for the quarter. Through the first nine months of the year, we're in a net recovery position of $895,000. On Page 27 of the investor presentation, is a new slide that we believe demonstrates that by proactively identifying criticized assets within our portfolio, we've been able to keep our net charge-off levels lower than our peers. While our credit metrics remain strong, we remain watchful of inflation pressures and other potential weaknesses in the broader economic environment.We are confident that our consistent and disciplined approach, to credit underwriting will continue to serve us well, should the economy show any material deterioration in the coming quarters. I'll now turn the call over to Bryan for an update on loan production.Bryan McDonald: Thanks, Tony. I'm going to provide detail on our third quarter loan production results, starting with our commercial lending group. For the quarter, our commercial teams closed $217 million in new loan commitments, up from $212 million last quarter and down from $277 million closed in the third quarter of 2022. Please refer to Page 19 in the third quarter investor presentation for additional detail on new originated loans over the past five quarters. The commercial loan pipeline ended the third quarter at $291 million, down from $473 million last quarter and down from $604 million at the end of the third quarter of 2022. Our heavy filtering of nonowner-occupied real estate loan request since March is the primary driver of the pipeline decline, although loan demand has also been softening as interest rates have moved higher.Loan growth was below last quarter at $15 million despite the higher volume of new loans originated, due to a combination of higher prepays and payoffs, lower net advances on loans and lower principal balance on loans originated in the quarter. Please see Slides 20 and 21 on the investor deck for further detail on the change in loans during the quarter. Based on our lower pipeline levels and the softening loan demand, we anticipate our organic loan growth rate, to be in the low single-digits over the next couple of quarters and largely driven by prepay levels and advances on construction loans. The deposit pipeline ended the quarter at $134 million, up from $118 million last quarter and balances associated with new deposit accounts, opened during the quarter totaled $39 million.The increase in the deposit pipeline is broad-based across the footprint, although we are seeing a higher concentration of new accounts coming from our new teams and the most disrupted markets. The Oregon and Portland MSA is the only major market where we saw net deposit growth during the quarter, with details reflected on Slide 10 of the investor presentation. Moving to interest rates. Our average third quarter interest rate for new commercial loans was 6.45%, which is 29 basis points higher than the 6.16% average for last quarter. In addition, the average third quarter rate for all new loans was 6.54%, up 27 basis points from 6.27% last quarter. The increase is due to a combination of higher underlying index rates and widening spreads implemented in 2023, versus working through the pipeline coming into the year that included pricing committed at lower levels.The market continues to be competitive, particularly for C&I relationships. The mortgage department closed $18 million in new loans in the third quarter of 2023, compared to $25 million closed in the second quarter of 2023 and $26 million in the third quarter of 2022. The mortgage loan pipeline ended the quarter at $10 million versus $13 million last quarter and $18 million at the end of the third quarter of 2022. With mortgage rates remaining at higher levels, we anticipate volumes will continue at the relatively low levels we have seen year-to-date. I'll now turn the call back to Jeff.Jeffrey Deuel: Thank you, Bryan. As I mentioned earlier, we're pleased with our performance in the third quarter. While we continue to experience the challenges of this rate environment and our deposit franchise, we are confident that the strength of our franchise will continue to benefit us over the long-term. Our relatively low loan-to-deposit ratio positions us well to continue to support our existing customers, as well as pursuing new high-quality relationships. And we will continue to focus on expense management and improving efficiencies, within the organization. Overall, we believe we are well positioned to navigate the challenges ahead and to take advantage, of any potential dislocation in our markets that may occur. That's the conclusion of our prepared comments. So Brika, we're ready to open the call to any questions callers may have.See also Top 30 Oncology Companies in the World and 25 Strongest Armies in the World in 2023.Q&A SessionOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question we have on the phone line comes from Matthew Clark of Piper Sandler. You may proceed with your question, Matthew.Matthew Clark: Thanks. Good morning, gentlemen. First one from me, just on the securities sold in the quarter, can you give us a sense for the timing of that sale and the yield pickup that you anticipate, from reinvesting those proceeds? And then as a follow-up to that, just your appetite to do more?Donald Hinson: So Matthew, we did it in September. So, we didn't really get much benefit of it in Q3. The overall - an estimated, again, we purchased some securities, about $23 million, at $566,000. The rest went into cash and of course that's earning about $540,000 of the $45 million that we sold. The average estimated pickup on the - annualized is $1.4 million or you might think of $350,000 per quarter on that. So, if you calculate that, that's about a NIM pickup of about two basis points.Matthew Clark: Yes. Okay. Thank you.Donald Hinson: And we - are considering doing more, we're going to watch the market and be selective. We did it. We could do this again. We could do more also depending on how we're feeling about where the market is at.Matthew Clark: Okay. And the yield on the securities sold, I can back into it, but just to make it easy on us?Donald Hinson: $246,000.Matthew Clark: Okay. Thank you. And then shifting gears to deposits. It looks like deposits were up in the region where you hire the bankers last year. Just - can you give us an update on that front? I assume none of that's brokered related? Is it all core? And then, again, maybe an update on what you're seeing in that Portland market with First Republic - that First Republic branch that's closed?Bryan McDonald: Sure. Matthew, it's Bryan. And you see it on Slide 10, the deposits were up about $73 million since the start of the year. So that's about a 13% growth rate versus the bank wide, we're down about 9%. And if you look at the chart above on Slide 10 and the Seattle MSA, we're actually down a little bit more 15%, just due to the amount of excess deposits - some of our customers had in that market. So, we are seeing disruption, we're seeing benefit from - benefit as you're seeing here. And it's not just from the new team, we're also seeing it positively benefit, on our other branches and other commercial teams in the market. And then the outlook is pretty favorable as well. I mentioned the pipeline numbers in my comments.And a significant portion of both the loan and deposit pipelines, are coming from our new teams. It's about 38% of the loan pipeline and then it's actually a little over 40% of the deposit pipeline. So, we're pleased with the outlook as well as the performance, and we are seeing disruption in that market from, as you mentioned, First Republic and the Columbia and Umpqua combo. And I'd also add, which I've said before, really the customers are coming from a variety of different spots, having the sales force down there without a portfolio out calling. Obviously, we're getting a lot of strong opportunities. Again, not just the new team, but all of our teams and bankers in that market.Matthew Clark: Okay. Great. And shifting to expenses, Don. You have an updated outlook on the run rate of non-interest expense is a little bit lighter than your low $42 million guide coming out of last quarter. I'm just curious, what your thoughts are on for 4Q?Donald Hinson: Yes, we had a little bit of benefit from things happened just kind of miscellaneous things for the quarter that kind of helped us out. I would say kind of - we are managing FTE levels to such that I think probably our run rate would have been like 41.5% type in that range. Now I will also say that we are looking at various initiatives on the expense side and from, our expense management initiatives. So even though that's probably a decent run rate, we are - we could potentially have higher expenses in a short - like, possibly in Q4 or Q1 of next year, as we review things like contracts, renegotiate contracts or even we could even exit contracts and take some hits upfront, that we feel is going to - we're not getting value and we're going to have savings going forward. So, there's a chance that we may see higher expenses in Q4. But if we do, we'll have benefits from it in future quarters.Matthew Clark: Okay. Great. And then last one from me, just on office CRE. Can you give us the magnitude or quantify the reserve associated with that portfolio at this stage? I know criticized were down a little bit this quarter to $21 million. But just the reserve you have against that portfolio. And then if you're seeing any differences or any weakness, I should say, in kind of the suburban office segment, considering we heard someone last night call out two nonperformers in suburban office in Southern California, totally different market, obviously?Anthony Chalfant: Yes, Matthew, this is Tony. I can take the first part and I think Don has the actual reserve number against the office portfolio. But we haven't seen a lot of weakness in our suburban office market. We continue to watch it closely, but nothing's really materialize from that standpoint. So not really much to add to my comments in that area.Donald Hinson: Yes. I'll just follow-up. We don't have any individually evaluated loans on the office side. But I think the percentage - overall percentage is 1.1%, the percentage on the office loans is around 1.56%, I believe, percent of the allowance. So as you - so I guess you can calculate the number. We have the numbers. I don't have the exact number, but we do disclose how many office loans we have, so you can kind of figure that out.Matthew Clark: Yes, got it. Okay. Thank you.Jeffrey Deuel: Thanks, Matt.Operator: We now have Jeff Rulis of D.A. Davidson.Jeff Rulis: Thanks. Good morning.Jeffrey Deuel: Good morning.Jeff Rulis: Jeff, maybe a question for you. Just checking in on capital. You've got CET1 close to 13%, total capital over 14%. You rattled through the TCE number. I guess, are there some in-house comfortability levels that you've exceeded at this point? And just - I mean, frankly, those levels haven't changed much over the last year. Just trying to get a feel for - if you want to inch those higher or can we think about - you want to be proactive when the time is right kind of thing with M&A? Thanks.Jeffrey Deuel: Thanks, Jeff. Don, I think that's a good question for you.Donald Hinson: Okay. Yes, as far as our capital levels, we are comfortable with our capital levels. Obviously, with the rate environment, the TCE ratio is probably lower than are ideal, but then we'll - assuming rates stay the same or don't go up much, we will see that come back into capital over a certain time period. And then as far as - we're using our capital for - we obviously are looking to grow. We may do some trades like we mentioned on the loss trade was a smaller one. We could do a bigger one, but that wouldn't impact TCE so much, it would impact regulatory capital. But we're comfortable with that. I don't think we necessarily have a large overabundance of capital. We did a few buybacks again in Q3, about $150 million, I think, or $150,000, sorry, of shares repurchased. We could continue to pick at that also. We don't have any plans to do any large-scale buybacks at this point.Jeff Rulis: Okay. It doesn't sound like you're uncomfortable on the high side to really deploy that. But - okay. Appreciate it?Donald Hinson: Regulatory capital start exceeding 10% and we might certainly be like our leverage ratio, we probably want to keep that under 10% in the current economic environment just, because I think you start getting over 10% and then we may not get the value of that. But right now, I think we're in the high 9s. So, I think we're fine.Jeff Rulis: Okay. Thanks Don. And then maybe, Tony, just on the - I know this is a squishy question in terms of reserve to loans and any guideline there. But that continues to lift as a percent of loans and you've been in a net recovery position for over two years now. I know those are specific credits, but just the thought of - if you're looking at low single-digit loan growth in the short run, your thoughts on the reserve. Do we kind of hold steady or continue to lift up as we've seen it?Anthony Chalfant: Yes. Don, I don't know if you want to take that with the - on the ACL?Donald Hinson: I think this holds steady. We don't have any plans to really change that. It's been pretty consistent. We've already considered all of - looking forward potential recessions is in the model. So again, we're - our underwriting is such that as you can see, we tend to always kind of outperform what we're putting on our criticized loan portfolio and with the actual amount of charge-offs. So, one of thing pops off the change, is the mix of loans and the amount of loans.Jeff Rulis: And then the - yes. Yes. I know that it's not black and white necessarily, but just trying to get a gut feel of where that is. It sounds like you're pretty comfortable with the level and - got you. One housekeeping, Don, while I have you - was there an interest recovery that added to margin in the quarter the 347, was there a bump there at all, that it flows through there?Donald Hinson: I don't believe so. I don't think we had anything that ballooned the loan yields at all, if that's what you're talking about.Jeff Rulis: Yes. From the credit side?Donald Hinson: I don't think we had any large - income recoveries on that.Jeff Rulis: Okay. And Don, did you mention about that expense growth rate in '24 expectations? I know that you kind of walked through the near term around 41.5% or a little higher in the short-term, it did take exiting contracts or something. But is that - I kind of - if I look at the balance of '24, is it right to say that's still going to be pretty managed growth, if at all, going to keep that growth rate pretty low?Donald Hinson: Yes. Obviously, in this rate environment, we're looking at all aspects to protect overall profitability. So I mentioned and maybe 41.5%, I have to be a little more specific, maybe into more say, mid-41s, right, for next quarter. But again, we are - I would say some things are lower right now, because of because profitability is down this quarter, compared to what was expected. So like, again, incentive comp accruals are down. If they go back to normalized levels, I would expect more of a $42 million run rate, that's kind of ex any tactics that we are in the process of looking at, but I would say the run rate was probably popped at $42 million a quarter starting in Q1, if we don't do anything else regarding that.Jeff Rulis: Okay. Thank you.Jeffrey Deuel: Thanks, Jeff.Operator: Thank you. We now have David Feaster of Raymond James.David Feaster: Hi, good morning everybody.Jeffrey Deuel: Good morning.David Feaster: Maybe just starting on the pipeline and the origination and loan growth side. Obviously, the pipeline decline - sounds like it's kind of a combination of maybe less appetite for credit from your standpoint, especially on the NOOCRE side, as well as weaker demand. I'm just curious, where are you still seeing good opportunities? What segments can still drive growth here and can pencil out even at higher rates? And then just how new loan yields are trending?Jeffrey Deuel: Bryan, do you want to take that one?Bryan McDonald: Yes. Sure, David. We have been - in the spring, we saw a big increase in real estate requests come in as other banks were pulling back on that category. And then concurrently, our prepay levels have come way down from what we had the last few years. So really, what we've been doing is managing our concentration levels has been the primary driver behind the heavy filtering we've done. Not to get too high in terms of our construction concentrations and our investor CRE concentration. So that was really the primary reason. The rates at the time were also a consideration in the spring, just as the new yields really hadn't adjusted. If you fast forward to today, the pricing is good on the investor real estate on the request that we're seeing coming in.We're just feeling - so, we're still building on that, but at a much lower level. So it's strong in that category. C&I activity, we're very focused on that. We've got a nice customer base and prospect base we've been going after. But the pricing pretty competitive in that space, obviously, because of the deposit aspects of those relationships. And in many cases, the customers we're looking at have very significant deposit levels. So from that standpoint, it makes sense if the loan pricing is competitive. And then overall, just with rates of customers that have been in business for 15 years or 20 years. They've experienced these rate levels in their business history and are reacting as strongly as some of the business customers that, have been in business for maybe the last 10 years or 15 that haven't experienced rate - these levels.So they're maybe pausing a little bit more on new projects. In general, the health of the local economy and the customer base is really good. Liquidity levels are strong. We are seeing a bit more use of cash to expand versus using gas in part, because of the pricing on new loans. Again, not a surprise with the liquidity levels that the customers might use more liquidity first. But overall, the economy is good. We're just - we are seeing a dip in demand, again, primarily based on rates. On the nonowner side, that's been our own choice to filter that hard. The volume has gone down in the market. But we could take a larger share if we chose to. And then you also asked on new rates, and I did mention those, the total for the total portfolio of new deals closed in the quarter, the average rate was 6.54%, which is up 27 basis points from last quarter.David Feaster: Okay. That's great color. And then maybe touching on the other side of the point on the credit front. I mean, credit is phenomenal. Nonaccruals are down. You've got the large ag recovery I'm just curious, we already touched on office, but maybe more broadly, what are you seeing on the credit front? I mean, we're starting to see some cracks and normalization in the industry. It can't get better than zero. I'm just curious, what are you watching? What are you seeing? And then maybe if you could talk a bit about what drove kind of that increase in classified balances in the quarter?Jeffrey Deuel: Tony, do you want to take that?Anthony Chalfant: Yes. Yes, sure, David. Generally, credit has been pretty benign now for quite a few quarters, as you mentioned. And I think we're still in a little bit of a credit bubble. And our numbers were a bit impacted by the recovery on the large deal this quarter. But it still even - if you netted that out, it would be lower than - much lower than historical for NCOs. And again, nonaccruals remains very low. So, I think we're still in that, what I would call a very slow move back to a more normal credit environment. It's just been slower than I expected over the last several quarters. So nothing really from a jumping out as to the small - the little increase in the classified numbers. It's just more just movement of credits between grades, and there was nothing really that jumped out.So, we're continuing to watch everything closely. But again, our total criticized numbers have stayed pretty stable, now for quite some time. And while there might be a little bit more pressure as we go forward, we've got quite a bit of room still to move, to get back to what I would call a more normal credit environment. I will say there's probably a little bit more weakness in the C&I space right now just. And I don't know really what to attribute that to, but I think it's just maybe the stimulus money that's worked its way through the economy and isn't really there to kind of prop some of those operating companies up. So, we're seeing a little bit more stress there, but nothing of any significance that's very alarming.David Feaster: Got it. And then maybe just touching on kind of the implications. It seems like we're going to on a higher for longer environment, at least that's kind of more of the consensus, it seems like. Maybe just on the margin and the NII trajectory, I guess, as we look out to next year, I guess, if rates do stay higher and funding pressures persist, talk about some margin compression. But I guess would you expect that in the upcoming quarter? I mean, I guess, would you expect that to persist kind of in the first half of the year? And I guess, just kind of how you think about the margin trajectory and kind of opportunities for expansion over time in a higher for longer environment?Donald Hinson: Yes. Sure. Yes, I think that we're going to continue to have some pressure as again, you mentioned how September was lower than NIM than for the quarter. Again, I think the pressure on deposits is really the factor. Again, our - the costs there are - will continue to go up. How quickly is -- it seems like we go in kind of waves where we get a lot of exception requests and in other times, there's less so. But with the rates higher and especially if the Fed increases another time where there's a lot out there on the short end of the curve, that could cause more problems and hurt us at least in the short run. For rates higher longer, at some point, the increases on the deposit side will subside and our assets will reprice and we'll hit an equilibrium. But at this point, we're probably looking maybe the middle of next year. Maybe it might happen Q2, but might not happen till Q3 at this point.David Feaster: Got it. That's helpful color. Thank you.Operator: Thank you. We now have Andrew Terrell of Stephens.Andrew Terrell: Hi, good morning.Jeffrey Deuel: Good morning.Andrew Terrell: I wanted to go back to the securities repositioning transaction. I appreciate all the color you guys provided there. As you're contemplating similar transactions moving forward, I know the one that took place this quarter was, I think you mentioned a 1.4-year earn back. Is that the kind of threshold you're looking to manage any incremental repositioning trades around, or would you be willing to extend to, call it, two, three years? Just want to get your thoughts there?Donald Hinson: At this point, 1.4 is a very good earn-back period. I don't - if we did a larger scale, I don't necessarily see that probably occurring, I imagine it would go over - maybe go over slightly over two years. We definitely want to keep it under three years and even two and a half would be preferable.Andrew Terrell: Yes. Okay. Yes and 1.4% is definitely....Donald Hinson: Yes, we'll continue to review this. And again, a lot will depend on really the rate environment and right now, of course, the rates have been up so far this quarter, which makes sales a little more challenging.Andrew Terrell: Yes. Understood. Okay. And then on the time deposit, portfolio. It looks like about a third of the growth came from brokered deposits. Can you just talk about the cost differential between the brokered deposit growth and the core customer time deposit growth? And on the core customer side, where are you pricing new deposits at today? And how does that compare to competitors in the market?Donald Hinson: Sure. The brokered, I think, came in around $5.45 million. We did those in July. So that had a - we've pretty much got the whole impact for the quarter there on the brokered. Again, brokered is just another way to manage the balance sheet. It's not - they're not core deposits. They're not the customer. So, we just use this one more instead of using borrowings, we can use brokered in that way. The new deposits coming on, I think a lot of them are in the 4% to almost 5% at times. We have gone up to 5% and even the low 5s periodically for new CDs. But I think on average, it's probably in the fours for the - for our customer CDs.Andrew Terrell: Okay. Got it. Thank you. And if I could ask something, Bryan, on the new origination yields for the quarter, you said 6.54% was the new origination yield all in?Bryan McDonald: Yes. So on the all loans, it was 6.54%.Andrew Terrell: Okay. As I look back to origination yields a year ago, I've got written down 4.89% in 3Q of last year. And we've obviously gotten it's a 160 basis point pickup. We've obviously gotten a lot more than that in terms of short-term rate increases. I'm just curious, is there anything influencing like - or could you talk about the range within that new origination yield? And is there anything such as old commitments that are funding up at lower rates. Anything that's influencing that number lower? And how you would expect new origination yields to progress over the next 12 or six months?Bryan McDonald: Yes. I mean, the range went from kind of the 6% range all the way up to 8.5%, just kind of looking at the full quarterly averages. So anything that's tied to a variable index prime or so far, you're getting strong rates. If you look at the renewal percentage, the rates on the renewals were over 8% for the quarter. Where we're really seeing strong pressures, anything C&I or owner occupied or anything kind of business related and that's, because Heritage and our competitors are really focused on deposits and that commercial category. So it's been super competitive in that space - the investor real estate or the construction less so. Your question on - did we have a carryover of commitments we made last year and the early part of the year, yes. And we've largely worked through that. So we expect to continue to see the pricing move up over the next few quarters, again, both spreads and indexes benefiting us at this point.Andrew Terrell: Okay. That's very helpful. I appreciate the color. If I could sneak one more in. Just - do you have the total dollar amount of syndicated credits in the portfolio?Anthony Chalfant: Yes, Andrew, the syndicated credits, SNCs is $75 million in outstandings at quarter end, which is about 1.75% of total loans. So it's a fairly small portfolio that we play in a pretty small portion of that space. Those deals that are higher rated and lower levered is really where we really focus our efforts.Andrew Terrell: Okay. Great. Thank you guys for taking the questions.Donald Hinson: Andrew, real quick, just a follow-up. I did look up the originator or the new CD rates for Q3 and it was around $450 million.Andrew Terrell: $450 million. Got it. Okay. Thank you.Jeffrey Deuel: Brika, do we have any other call, any other questions?Operator: We now have Kelly Motta from KBW on the line.Jeffrey Deuel: Sure. Thank you. Hi Kelly.Kelly Motta: Hi, good morning. Most of my questions have been asked and answered at this stage. But maybe if we could go back to office. Can you remind us how much of that portfolio reprices or comes up for renewal over the next year or two?Jeffrey Deuel: Tony, I think you have some good data on that, with regard to...Anthony Chalfant: I do. Yes. I mean I don't have it over the next year, but of that, Kelly, of that portfolio, that's about $563 million, which includes owner and nonowner occupied. If I look at the amount of that, it's actually over the next three years is what I haven't done, may have something a little more specific. But I've got about a little over $70 million of that portfolio. So over a three-year period, we feel like that's a pretty low amount of maturing loans. Now that doesn't include some repricing that might be in there, too. So...Kelly Motta: Got it. That's really helpful, Tony. And then, in your prepared remarks, I think one area that you're sort of looking at is expense control. Just wondering how you're balancing that with what you're viewing as opportunities to benefit from the dislocation in your markets and the ability to add teams. Like, how would you kind of stack rank those priorities as we sit here at this stage of the cycle?Jeffrey Deuel: Well, Kelly, I think it's that time of year where all of us are starting to plan for the new year. And we've said many times in the past that expenses is just one thing that we can control. We're always watching expenses, particularly comp and benefits for one, because it's one of our biggest categories. We'll continue to focus on that as we plan for '24. I think there's pockets with inside the organization that we can spend some time on that's in our control. Don referenced maybe looking at contracts, whether it's renewing, renegotiating or maybe releasing them all together is one thing we can do. But there is an underlying belief on the part of the leadership and the Board, who are in full support of this line of thinking that first choice when it comes to acquiring would be teams in our footprint.And we've done that many times. While we're really focused on maintaining or controlling our expenses as they stand today. I don't think that, that would stop us from pursuing the right teams in the right locations that they presented themselves. We are also very well aware of how much of an impact the two team projects that we just brought on over the last 18 months has had on our expense base, but we can kind of carve that out and show how that's impacting us. For example, we've kind of gone through the exercise of saying, okay, assuming that these teams that we brought on are fully functioning today as opposed to as we model three years out, that's about four points on our efficiency ratio, which gives us a little bit of relief as we as we monitor our metrics.And I think that we are now seeing the beauty of those teams bringing on, as Bryan walked through the benefits. The deposits and the loans that we're bringing on and fleshing out those geographic locations, I think it's a great way for us to grow the organization. M&A is close behind, but we all know M&A is pretty rough right now and probably not front and center for us in the next, I don't know, six months at least.Kelly Motta: Thanks Jeff for all the color. Appreciate it. I'll step back.Jeffrey Deuel: Thank you.Operator: We now have Tim Coffey of Janney. You may proceed.Timothy Coffey: Hi, thanks. Good morning, everybody.Jeffrey Deuel: Good morning, Tim.Timothy Coffey: Don, I had a question about - kind of the NII outlook. Is it a reasonable expectation to think that it might be flat here for a couple of quarters, even if NIM does compress?Donald Hinson: Well, I think that a lot will depend on our deposits. Can we - will the deposits continue to stabilize, can we maintain on interest-bearing deposits. That's a key, because then the margin is - I think is going to continue, again, it will continue to decrease more slowly, but still decrease some. So it will be a challenge. I mean, it came down a little bit, and we actually increased our average earning assets for the quarter. I'm not sure that's going to happen every quarter right now. But again, it's so dependent on deposits. I think we might see it continue a little bit of a decline in the NII.Timothy Coffey: Okay. Okay. And since you brought it a little while ago, Don, the request for exception pricing on deposits, the pace of that, has that changed in 3Q relative to 2Q?Donald Hinson: Unfortunately, no. It's still pretty - I think the dollar amounts have decreased some, but I think the numbers are still pretty high.Timothy Coffey: Okay. And then, Jeff, just - I want to follow-up on the M&A comments you just made there. So in the third quarter in the Western region, we saw some interesting sophisticatedly structured transactions, right? Where, one, the legal buyer was different from the accounting buyer. And just recently, we saw a take under. Do you think - thinking creatively about how to structure M&A transactions might unlock the M&A market regardless of the kind of fair value marks all the banks seem to be carrying?Jeffrey Deuel: Yes. I think that - well, we haven't - those particular deals were not lost on us. We spent a lot of time looking at them, and it sort of opened our eyes to the variety of creative ways of going about these deals that are out there. I think we would certainly consider any kind of structure that makes sense for us to get a deal done. But I just don't see - our conversations continue as they always have, like keeping close contact with a lot of the organizations that we have admiration for. But I think regardless of what the creative structure is, I just don't think there's deals to be done right now.Timothy Coffey: Okay. Okay yes.Jeffrey Deuel: Historically, I just want to add, historically, the deals we did do were mainly, because of retiring CEO without specific succession and the scenarios now are a little different than that. They're not as urgent. So, I think a lot of the potential targets are taking their time to decide what they want to do.Timothy Coffey: Yes. No that's make a lot of sense. It does. Thank you very much. Those are my questions.Jeffrey Deuel: Thank you. Brika, any more questions.Operator: Thank you. I'd like to turn it back to Jeff Deuel, CEO, for any final remarks.Jeffrey Deuel: Perfect. Thank you. We'll wrap up this quarter's call. We thank you for your time and your support and your interest in our ongoing performance, and we look forward to talking with many of you in the next couple of weeks. Take care, and goodbye.Operator: Thank you all for joining. I then confirm that does conclude today's call. Please have a lovely rest of your day, and you may now disconnect your lines."
2023-10-21,"For beginners, it can seem like a good idea (and an exciting prospect) to buy a company that tells a good story to investors, even if it currently lacks a track record of revenue and profit. But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Great Southern Bancorp (NASDAQ:GSBC). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. View our latest analysis for Great Southern Bancorp How Quickly Is Great Southern Bancorp Increasing Earnings Per Share?If a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. Over the last three years, Great Southern Bancorp has grown EPS by 16% per year. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. It's noted that Great Southern Bancorp's revenue from operations was lower than its revenue in the last twelve months, so that could distort our analysis of its margins. Great Southern Bancorp maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 6.5% to US$235m. That's encouraging news for the company!The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. For finer detail, click on the image.earnings-and-revenue-historyYou don't drive with your eyes on the rear-view mirror, so you might be more interested in this free report showing analyst forecasts for Great Southern Bancorp's future profits.Story continuesAre Great Southern Bancorp Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?It's pleasing to see company leaders with putting their money on the line, so to speak, because it increases alignment of incentives between the people running the business, and its true owners. Shareholders will be pleased by the fact that insiders own Great Southern Bancorp shares worth a considerable sum. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$148m. Coming in at 26% of the business, that holding gives insiders a lot of influence, and plenty of reason to generate value for shareholders. Very encouraging.While it's always good to see some strong conviction in the company from insiders through heavy investment, it's also important for shareholders to ask if management compensation policies are reasonable. Our quick analysis into CEO remuneration would seem to indicate they are. Our analysis has discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like Great Southern Bancorp with market caps between US$200m and US$800m is about US$2.5m.Great Southern Bancorp's CEO took home a total compensation package worth US$1.6m in the year leading up to December 2022. That seems pretty reasonable, especially given it's below the median for similar sized companies. While the level of CEO compensation shouldn't be the biggest factor in how the company is viewed, modest remuneration is a positive, because it suggests that the board keeps shareholder interests in mind. It can also be a sign of good governance, more generally.Does Great Southern Bancorp Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?One positive for Great Southern Bancorp is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. The fact that EPS is growing is a genuine positive for Great Southern Bancorp, but the pleasant picture gets better than that. With a meaningful level of insider ownership, and reasonable CEO pay, a reasonable mind might conclude that this is one stock worth watching. However, before you get too excited we've discovered 1 warning sign for Great Southern Bancorp that you should be aware of.Although Great Southern Bancorp certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares. If you like to see insider buying, then this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying, could be exactly what you're looking for.Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.Have feedback on this article?

2023-10-22,"There's no doubt that money can be made by owning shares of unprofitable businesses. For example, biotech and mining exploration companies often lose money for years before finding success with a new treatment or mineral discovery. But while history lauds those rare successes, those that fail are often forgotten; who remembers Pets.com?So, the natural question for Trilogy Metals (TSE:TMQ) shareholders is whether they should be concerned by its rate of cash burn. For the purpose of this article, we'll define cash burn as the amount of cash the company is spending each year to fund its growth (also called its negative free cash flow). The first step is to compare its cash burn with its cash reserves, to give us its 'cash runway'. See our latest analysis for Trilogy Metals How Long Is Trilogy Metals' Cash Runway?A company's cash runway is the amount of time it would take to burn through its cash reserves at its current cash burn rate. In August 2023, Trilogy Metals had US$3.5m in cash, and was debt-free. In the last year, its cash burn was US$3.2m. Therefore, from August 2023 it had roughly 13 months of cash runway. While that cash runway isn't too concerning, sensible holders would be peering into the distance, and considering what happens if the company runs out of cash. Depicted below, you can see how its cash holdings have changed over time.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Is Trilogy Metals' Cash Burn Changing Over Time?Trilogy Metals didn't record any revenue over the last year, indicating that it's an early stage company still developing its business. So while we can't look to sales to understand growth, we can look at how the cash burn is changing to understand how expenditure is trending over time. Even though it doesn't get us excited, the 24% reduction in cash burn year on year does suggest the company can continue operating for quite some time. While the past is always worth studying, it is the future that matters most of all. So you might want to take a peek at how much the company is expected to grow in the next few years.Story continuesHow Easily Can Trilogy Metals Raise Cash?While Trilogy Metals is showing a solid reduction in its cash burn, it's still worth considering how easily it could raise more cash, even just to fuel faster growth. Companies can raise capital through either debt or equity. One of the main advantages held by publicly listed companies is that they can sell shares to investors to raise cash and fund growth. By looking at a company's cash burn relative to its market capitalisation, we gain insight on how much shareholders would be diluted if the company needed to raise enough cash to cover another year's cash burn.Since it has a market capitalisation of US$76m, Trilogy Metals' US$3.2m in cash burn equates to about 4.2% of its market value. That's a low proportion, so we figure the company would be able to raise more cash to fund growth, with a little dilution, or even to simply borrow some money.Is Trilogy Metals' Cash Burn A Worry?The good news is that in our view Trilogy Metals' cash burn situation gives shareholders real reason for optimism. Not only was its cash burn reduction quite good, but its cash burn relative to its market cap was a real positive. Cash burning companies are always on the riskier side of things, but after considering all of the factors discussed in this short piece, we're not too worried about its rate of cash burn. Taking a deeper dive, we've spotted  5 warning signs for Trilogy Metals you should be aware of, and 3 of them are a bit unpleasant.If you would prefer to check out another company with better fundamentals, then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt or this list of stocks which are all forecast to grow.Have feedback on this article?

2023-10-23,"HONG KONG, Oct. 23, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Highway Holdings Limited (Nasdaq: HIHO, ""the Company"" or ""Highway Holdings"") today reported results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 and the six months ended September 30, 2023.Reflecting the significantly negative impact of the post-COVID boom and bust cycle on Highway Holdings' customers' demand levels, which was made worse by the compounding effect of the ongoing Russia/Ukraine war and global inflation, net sales for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 were $1.3 million, compared with $3.0 million in the year ago period. While still able to maintain profitability, the negative operating environment led to a reduction in net income for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 to $213,000, or $0.05 per diluted share, compared with a net income of $396,000, or $0.10 per diluted share in the year ago period. The Company cautions that the net income comparison should not be viewed by investors as an accurate measure of normalized operations because the year ago period benefitted from reduced rental expenses provided by the Chinese government and some salary subsidies provided by the Hong Kong government to the Company. In addition, the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 benefitted from the reversal of approximately 80% of a bad debt reserve following the collection of amounts that had been outstanding for almost two years.Net sales for the first half of fiscal year 2024 were only $2.7 million, compared with $6 million in the year-ago period. Net loss for the first half of fiscal year 2024 was $125,000, or $0.03 per diluted share, compared with net income of $783,000 or $0.19 per diluted share in the year-ago period.Roland Kohl, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Highway Holdings, noted, ""We are experiencing an extremely difficult operating environment, with pressure across all points of our business. We took action to reduce costs where opportunities existed, which helped us to reduce our expenses.  In addition, we benefitted from a one-time reversal of previously taken provisions for potential bad debts. The combination of the negative impact of the COVID boom and bust cycle, demand reduction related to the ongoing Russia/Ukraine war, global inflation, and severe supply constraints, however, had too great a negative impact on customer demand and ultimately our topline revenue. Despite the incredibly challenging environment, we have recently started to see some positive signs. In particular, we expect to benefit from a resumption in demand from one of our larger customers, Playmaji, Inc., which owns the Polymega game console business. Playmaji recently announced that it has entered into a partnership with, and has received a minority investment from Atari. Based on discussions with Playmaji, a return to full production in Q3 2023 is anticipated, with regular deliveries to customers and distributors to continue thereafter. Importantly, the improved situation allowed the customer to pay us in full all outstanding owed amounts that were held on record for approximately two years, which resulted in the above-noted reversal of a bad debt reserve.""Story continues""We are cautiously optimistic that we have come through the worst part of this cycle. We believe that we have a healthy balance sheet that will enable us to emerge successful over the long-term as the business environment further improves. We are fully committed to building value for the Company and our shareholders, as we continue to build on our track record of success over the long-term.""Select Additional Financial Results: Gross profit for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 was $383,000 compared with $1,099,000 a year ago mainly due to the decline in sales. Gross profit as a percentage of sales for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 was 29.0 percent, compared to 36.1 percent in the year ago period. Gross profit for the first half of fiscal year 2024 was $760,000 compared with $2.1 million in the year ago period. Gross profit as a percentage of sales for the first half of fiscal year 2024 was 28.5 percent compared with 35.9 percent in the year ago period. The Company noted these comparisons are not very meaningful due to the production, supply chain, logistics and overall business disruptions related to the COVID boom and bust cycle, and the above noted non-recurring salary and rental benefits the Company received in the year ago period, which benefits the Company did not receive in the current fiscal year period.Selling, general and administrative expenses for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 decreased to $272,000 from $716,000, reflecting the above-noted bad debt provision reversal, combined with the Company's major cost cutting actions. The year ago period included the above mentioned benefits of reduced rental expenses provided by the Chinese government and some salary subsidies provided by the Hong Kong government to the Company, which did not repeat in the current second quarter of fiscal year 2024. Net income for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 reflects a currency exchange gain of $14,000 compared to a $6,000 gain in the year ago period. The Company reported a currency exchange gain of $31,000 for the first half of fiscal year 2024, compared with a $24,000 gain in the year ago period.The Company had interest income of approximately $53,000 for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, and interest income of approximately $93,000 for the first half of fiscal year 2024 due to the increase in interest rates.The Company's balance sheet remains strong, with $12.3 million dollar of total  assets and cash and cash equivalents in excess of $7.0 million, or approximately $1.62 per diluted share. The cash and cash equivalent amount exceeded all of its short- and long-term liabilities by approximately $2.4 million. Total shareholders' equity at September 30, 2023, was $7.7 million, or $1.80 per diluted share.About Highway Holdings LimitedHighway Holdings is an international manufacturer of a wide variety of quality parts and products for blue chip equipment manufacturers based primarily in Germany.

We are starting to realize the benefits of our Limestone merger along with our strong organic growth, which is evidenced in our record earnings for the third quarter. Compared to the linked quarter, our net interest income grew 10% and our fee-based revenue increased 3%. Our return on average stockholder equity improved to 12.6% for the quarter, while our return on average tangible stockholder equity was 23%. Our return on average assets also increased to 1.44% for the third quarter. Our net charge-off levels remained low and were 15 basis points of average loans on an annualized basis. We had strong loan growth of $110 million or 7% annualized compared to the linked quarter end.We had increases in our deposit balances of $78 million compared to the linked quarter, which was mainly due to our successful campaign for retail CDs during the quarter. Our loan to deposit ratio stayed flat compared to the linked quarter at 86%. We generated positive operating leverage compared to the linked quarter, prior year quarter, and first nine months of 2022. Our earnings for the quarter totaled $31.9 million and increased 51% compared to the linked quarter and 23% from the prior year quarter. Diluted earnings per share were $0.90 and were negatively impacted by $0.15 of onetime cost during the third quarter, which included: Limestone acquisition related expenses of $4.4 million resulting in a $0.10 decrease in diluted EPS; a $2.4 million pension settlement charge associated with the final termination of our pension plan, which negatively impacted diluted EPS by $0.05.We will no longer be recognizing any future ongoing cost or settlement charges related to our pension plan as a result of this final termination. Moving on to our credit quality. Our allowance for credit losses represented 1.03% of total loans at quarter end. A higher allowance compared to the linked quarter was attributed to several factors including loan growth during the quarter, updates to our prepayment, curtailment and funding rates, and deterioration of macroeconomic conditions used within our CECL model. All of these increases were partially offset by a decline in our reserve for individually analyzed loans. The reduction in our reserves for individually analyzed loans was largely due to the payoff of a single commercial real estate relationship.This relationship totaled $5.3 million at June 30th and was on nonaccrual and included in our criticized and classified asset balances at the linked quarter end. We also recorded a $110,000 charge-off on this relationship at payoff during the third quarter. Non-performing assets remained flat compared to the linked quarter and were 48% of total assets at September 30th. A portion of our loan portfolio considered current at quarter end was 99%, which is flat compared to June 30th. For the quarter, our annualized net charge off rate was 15 basis points consistent with the prior year quarter and an increase from 9 basis points for the linked quarter. On a year-to-date basis, our annualized net charge-off rate was 13 basis points for 2023 compared to 15 basis points for the first nine months of 2022.Criticized loans declined to 3.5% of total loans at quarter end, while our classified loans increased and were 2.05% of total loans. As it relates to commercial office space, which is a very small portion of our loan portfolio, our total outstanding balances were $136 million at quarter end and represented 2% of our total loan portfolio. We continue to see high demand and successful project execution with our construction portfolio. There have been occasional construction delays. However, these projects have generally been leasing up at appropriate speeds and often at higher rents than projected. We typically work with high net worth individuals who are able to withstand increases in interest carrying costs, and delays in timing. We have witnessed a number of construction projects achieving certificate of occupancy in the third quarter and more are likely in the fourth quarter.As a result, construction loans saw a decline in outstanding balances at quarter close. The current portfolio has $374 million in outstanding balances compared to $689 million in commitments. Land development remains a small percentage of the portfolio, representing $106 million or 1.7% of total loans at quarter end. Our multifamily balance continued to grow as projects come through the construction phase and now rest at $501 million. This sector has advanced not only due to construction seasonality, but also from the Limestone merger, which had outstanding balances of $235 million at the end of the first quarter. Our top 10 multifamily loans accounted for 38% of the funded multifamily portfolio, six of which are in the construction phase. These projects are located within growth markets with strong metrics and notable guarantor support.Hospitality loan balances were $192 million at quarter end and comprised 3% of our total loan portfolio. Our hospitality loan balances have grown in 2023 due to the Limestone merger. However, we were able to exit an out-of-market hotel in the third quarter that was acquired through the Limestone merger. The Limestone acquisition shifted the geographic distribution of our hospitality portfolio. Six of our 10 largest exposures are located in the State of Kentucky, including the suburbs of Cincinnati, Ohio. Other hotel projects span throughout our footprint with a concentration in Ohio. The top 10 funded loans with flag hotels represent 47% of the hospitality portfolio at quarter end. Occupancy trends within the portfolio generally remain above market competitors with trailing 12- and trailing 3-month occupancy reported at 76% and 82% respectively.We continue to be highly selective in this segment and are working with high net worth individuals that provide sponsor support including liquidity. We do not plan to increase our hotel exposure as a percentage of total loans in a meaningful way, and we'll continue to manage our portfolio exposure where we can. Specific assets are anticipated to be sold or refinanced in the fourth quarter, which will shift the overall project mix. We continue to closely monitor our dealer floor plan portfolio and are assessing the potential impact of the United Auto Workers' strike on the portfolio. At quarter end, we had $340 million of exposure to vehicle dealers, 30% of which was to domestic franchise auto dealers and another 7% with the specialty vehicle dealers who are supplied by the domestic manufacturers.The remaining 63% of the portfolio was evenly distributed among independent auto, foreign franchise auto, commercial truck and RV dealers. Our domestic franchise dealers are currently well stocked with new vehicle inventory, so the strikes have not yet had a meaningful impact on vehicle sales. We believe our larger clients have liquidity positions to withstand short-term delays in the delivery of vehicles should the strike persists. Our largest 11 floor plan clients have an average debt service ratio of 3.3x with a trust position approaching 2x. Our top 5 floor plan commitments totaled $87 million, while the top 11 covered nearly $150 million in commitment. Compared to the linked quarter end, our total loan balances grew $110 million or 7% annualized.The largest contributor of our growth compared to June 30th was our commercial real estate loans, which grew $118 million while our specialty finance businesses provided over $51 million in growth. Consumer indirect loans were up $14 million while we had some declines in construction and commercial and industrial loan balances compared to the linked quarter end. At quarter end, our commercial real estate loans comprised 36% of total loans, nearly 40% of which were owner occupied. At the same time our total consumer loans were 29% of total loans, commercial and industrial loans were 19%, specialty finance totaled 10% and construction loans were 6%. At September 30th, 48% of our total loans were fixed rate with the remaining 52% at a variable rate.Additionally, while our premium finance loans are fixed rate, these loans operate similar to variable rate loans and they reprice every nine months. I will now turn the call over to Tyler for additional details about our fee-based income, deposits and the Limestone systems conversions.Tyler Wilcox: Thanks, Chuck. Our fee-based income improved 3% compared to the linked quarter, was 15% higher than the prior year quarter, and grew 13% compared to the first nine months of 2022. The increases were driven by the additional accounts from the Limestone merger, which resulted in higher deposit account service charge income compared to the linked quarter and prior year periods, as well as higher electronic banking income compared to the prior year periods. Our insurance income has increased considerably this year, mainly due to client acquisition efforts and hardening insurance markets. We also recorded a debt benefit associated with our bank owned life insurance during the third quarter of 2023, which totaled around $400,000.During the quarter, we recorded $1.3 million of operating lease income, which drove the increase in other non-interest income. At the same time, our lease income declined $1.8 million compared to the linked quarter as we recognized the unwind of a residual premium related to two leases from the Vantage acquisition, which paid off during the quarter. The residual premiums were a result of the fair values associated with the acquisition accounting for the Vantage acquisition. Moving on to our deposit book, we increased our deposit balances by $78 million compared to the linked quarter end. Our retail CDs grew $248 million as a result of our recent campaigns, which more than offset the decline in our non-interest bearing deposits. We typically have seasonal increases in our governmental deposits during the third quarter of each year, which contributed to growth of $56 million.As we mentioned last quarter, we have utilized brokered CDs in recent periods as a funding mechanism as it provides us with a lower funding cost than the FHLB borrowings we might otherwise use, and the brokered CDs do not require us to pledge collateral. Our demand deposits comprised 39% of total deposits at quarter end compared to 42% at June 30th. At quarter end, our deposit composition included 79% in retail deposit balances, which is comprised of consumers and small businesses and 21% in commercial deposit balances. Our average consumer -- our average customer deposit relationship was $29,000 at September 30th while our median was $2,400. During August, we successfully completed the conversion of the Limestone system to our core system.This helps our lines of business interact together in a more coordinated effort and allows for collaboration between business partners to optimize our offerings to our new clients. We continue to work on the expansion of our business model throughout our new footprint. As part of our culture and core values, we always make helping our communities in priority. I'm pleased to note that we now have over 65% of our associates contributing a portion of their paychecks to local food banks, which result in approximately $200,000 of annual contributions. Another part of our core values is providing our associates with a top notch workplace and environment. We're excited to note that Energage recognized us for the second year in a row as one of the top workplaces in the financial services industry for 2023.Next, I will turn the call over to Katie, who will provide additional details around our financial performance.Kathryn Bailey: Thanks, Tyler. Our net interest income continues to grow as we benefited from a full quarter of the Limestone merger, organic growth, high market interest rates and our controlled funding costs. Compared to the linked quarter, net interest income was up 10% and net interest margin expanded 16 basis points to 4.70%. During the quarter, our net interest income and margin increased as we refined the fair value marks from our Limestone merger and related accretion income, net of amortization expense. This resulted in an additional $1.9 million in accretion income from May and June being recognized during the third quarter of 2023. For the third quarter, accretion income totaled $9.8 million and positively impacted our net interest margin by 49 basis points.A higher accretion income for the quarter benefited our loan yields and helped offset increases in our funding costs. As Tyler mentioned, we had retail CD growth from our recently advertised specials. However, we controlled the rates we offered and held the increase in our funding costs relatively low for the quarter. Our total deposit cost was 128 basis points for the third quarter, compared to 87 basis points for the linked quarter. Excluding brokered deposits, our total deposit cost for the quarter was 94 basis points compared to 63 basis points for the linked quarter. Compared to the prior year quarter, our net interest income grew 39%, while our net interest margin expanded 53 basis points. On a year-to-date basis, our net interest income increased 37% and margin grew 93 basis points.Since the beginning of 2022, the Federal Reserve has increased rates a total of 5.25% and over the same time period, our interest-bearing deposit rates have gone up 1.45% and are up 1.1% if you exclude brokered CDs. At the same time, our deposit betas have moved 28%. Moving on to expenses. Our total non-interest expense increased 2% compared to the linked quarter. Our acquisition-related expenses for the quarter totaled $4.4 million. We recorded a pension settlement charge of $2.4 million and we recognized a full quarter of operating costs from the expanded Limestone footprint. Compared to the prior year quarter, total non-interest expense increased 37% and was 29% higher on a year-to-date basis. The comparison to these prior periods have been impacted by the acquisition-related expenses, the Limestone merger and on a year-to-date basis, the Vantage lease acquisition.Our reported efficiency ratio improved and was 58.4% for the quarter, compared to 62.7% for the linked quarter. When adjusted for non-core expenses, our efficiency ratio was 52.5%, compared to 53.3% for the linked quarter. This quarter was our best adjusted efficiency ratio in decades. For the first 9 months of 2023, our reported efficiency ratio was 54.2% compared to 59.6% for 2022. Moving on to the balance sheet. At September 30th, our investment securities portfolio declined to 19.7% of total assets compared to 21.3% at the linked quarter end. We utilized cash flows from our investment portfolio during the quarter to fund a portion of our loan growth. We believe the investment portfolio continues to be well positioned for potential movements in interest rates.We will benefit from higher rates and should not be significantly impacted by falling rates. We intend to be opportunistic as it relates to our investment portfolio and potential restructuring. Our capital levels continue to be strong and increased compared to the linked quarter end. The improvement was a result of our higher earnings which included a full quarter of Limestone. At quarter end, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 11.5%, our total risk-based capital ratio was 13.1% and our leverage ratio was 9.5%. As I had mentioned in our call last quarter, our leverage ratio was inflated due to the Limestone merger and is now at a normal level. Our tangible equity to tangible asset ratio was 6.9% at quarter end and declined compared to 7% at the linked quarter end.This ratio continues to be impacted by our accumulated other comprehensive losses, which grew this quarter and was driven by the higher market interest rate. I will now turn the call back to Chuck for his final comments.Charles Sulerzyski: Thank you, Katie. We continue to have strong earnings, asset quality and many other positive metrics compared to prior periods. We believe in our business model and work hard to execute our strategic initiatives daily. We have consistently mentioned how we are positioning ourselves to cross $10 billion in assets. We are making many investments in systems, associates, and processes in order to have a successful transition. Along those lines, we have hired senior talent that will allow us to execute our plan. As far as the cost, we estimate that we have already incurred more of that expense at this point than we have left to pick up. We continue to make investments in our systems in order to have best-in-class systems.These include the current process of implementing a new customer relationship system and replacing our e-mail and communications software with Microsoft. Moving on to our expectations for the full year of 2023, excluding acquisition-related expenses, we anticipate our net interest income and margin will experience some compression in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, but we still believe it'll be between 4.5% and 4.7% for the full year. Excluding the acquired Limestone loans, we believe our annual organic loan growth will be between 6% and 8%. We expect fee-based income percentage growth to be in the low to mid double digits compared to 2022. We are still anticipating a 22% to 24% increase in our total noninterest expenses for 2023, excluding acquisition-related expenses compared to the full year of 2022, which continues to assume we achieve our anticipated cost savings associated with Limestone merger.This assumes our fourth quarter noninterest expense is between $65 million and $67 million. We still expect our efficiency ratio excluding one-time expenses to be between 55% and 57% for the full year, including Limestone. We expect our net charge-off rate during 2023 will be relatively consistent with 2022. For the third quarter, the analyst consensus estimate of our core diluted EPS was $0.93 per share. Excluding our acquisition-related expenses and pension settlement charges, we exceeded this expectation by $0.12. We have exceeded the quarterly consensus estimates 13 of the last 14 consecutive quarters. For the one quarter we missed in 2021, if you exclude the acquisition cost in day 1 provision for credit losses related to the Premier acquisition, we would've beaten estimates.The current core consensus estimate for 2023 diluted EPS is $3.87. We continue to expect to beat the consensus estimate for the full year of 2023, excluding acquisition-related expenses, pension settlement charges and one-time provision for credit losses for the acquired Limestone loans. I would like to give some high level guidance for 2024, which is preliminary. We expect higher net interest income as we will see the full year benefit of the Limestone merger. We believe our fee-based income growth will be in the low double digit percentages compared to 2023. We expect quarterly non-interest expense to be between $67 million and $69 million for the second, third and fourth quarters of 2024 with the first quarter of 2024 being higher due to our annual expenses we typically recognize during the first quarter of each year.We believe our loan growth will be between 6% and 8% compared to 2023. As a result of this projected growth, we're also anticipating an increase in our provision for credit losses excluding the one-time provision recorded for the Limestone merger in 2023. We will update this guidance in January at our next call. We are looking forward to capitalizing on our recent successes and will continue to develop our relationships with our clients. Our lines of businesses are focused on working together to identify client needs and improve our overall client experience. With that being said, the current core consensus estimate for diluted EPS for the full year of 2024 is $3.61. At this time, we feel confident in our ability to achieve this estimate. This concludes our commentary and we will open the call for questions.Once again, this is Chuck Sulerzyski and joining me for the Q&A session is Tyler Wilcox, Chief Operating Officer; and Katie Bailey, our Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call back into the hands of our call facilitator, Anthony.Operator: We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Daniel Tamayo with Raymond James. You may now go ahead.See also 10 Best Dialysis and Kidney Disease Stocks to Buy and 12 Most Undervalued Travel Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.Q&A SessionDaniel Tamayo: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe we start on the margin and particularly the loan yields, which remained very high. Obviously, you had the onetime benefit from accretion in the third quarter. But just curious if you think we're nearing a peak there? Or if not, kind of how that plays out assuming rates are relatively stable here over the next few quarters? And if you could just fill us in on your thoughts on accretion as well going forward?Charles Sulerzyski: I'll start with the yields and I'll have Katie talk about accretion. Our yields weighted average for the quarter were 8.5%. We think there's still some room to improve there, a little bit, but we're nearing the top. Your guess is as good as mine on rate increases. I wouldn't surprise me if there is another rate increase in the next quarter or two. But if there is, we'll see even higher yields.Kathryn Bailey: Yes. And Daniel, as it relates to accretion, so as noted in the script and in the earnings release, there was a true-up in the third quarter, which $1.9 million of that should have been recorded in the second quarter, but we're using an estimate in the second quarter. And as we refine the purchase accounting, are finalizing some of those numbers. So, I would say as quoted in the script, it was 49 basis points of accretion was the benefit in the third quarter. If you take out that piece that related to the second quarter, it would have been closer to 40 basis points impact. And I think we can expect that 35 to 40 in the first quarter of benefit. If we go back to kind of day 1 purchase accounting for the Limestone acquisition, about 85% of our mark on loans was related to interest rates, and the other 15 related to credit.So again, the rate environment created a much bigger discount than we've seen in prior deals when rates were relatively low and stable. So we'll continue to see some higher accretion numbers as those loans continue to pay down. I would say we haven't seen a lot of payoffs in that portfolio. So much of that is just the normal accretion that we'll get on a quarterly basis as that portfolio matures and has principal payments.Daniel Tamayo: And then I guess on the other side of the equation, the CD maturities that you have, just curious -- sorry, the CDs that you already have on the book, just curious maturities on those, if anything is going to be maturing in the next few quarters. I apologize if you mentioned that in the comments. And then not sure if you have any kind of overall thoughts on where the margin may end up next year as it kind of comes down from a high here?Kathryn Bailey: Yes. So on the CDs, the specials, we've been running anywhere from kind of 7 to 14 months. So they will start to mature in the coming quarters, and we continue to remain active on our marketing efforts and price or yields on those. As it relates to margin going into the fourth quarter and into 2024, as we quoted, we do expect some compression in the fourth quarter and I think we expect it to kind of hit bottom there, but hold relatively stable from that point into the '24 period. So I think that we've quoted -- we guided to 2023 for the full year will be $4.50 to $4.60 or $4.70, and I think you'll see us a little south of that range for the '24 year.Operator: Our next question will come from Terry McEvoy with Stephens.Terry McEvoy: Katie, maybe a question for you. Could you just talk about managing the size of the balance sheet? Will you continue to pay down short-term borrowings and are there additional actions within the securities portfolio for additional restructuring?Kathryn Bailey: Yes. So as -- short-term borrowing is a function of loan growth and deposit flows. And so we'll continue to manage that on a daily basis as we have historically. On the investment securities, as we referenced in the script, we continually evaluate opportunities to restructure that portfolio. As you might recall, we did a meaningful amount in the first quarter and took a loss of about $2 million at that time, and to the extent there are securities which we experienced. That said, that gains, we will likely offset those to clean up some of the lower yielding securities and offset the loss there. We will continue to evaluate that trade. And when we look at that, we look at it from what is the loss we are willing to accept in the quarter as well as what is the payback on that and kind of locking in the payback somewhere between 1.5 years to 2 years is kind of where we range -- where we look at the range for the payback on that trade as it relates to the investment security restructuring option.Terry McEvoy: Thanks for that. And then just Limestone, I know this was touched on throughout the call, but are cost savings tracking in line with expectations, anything to comment on deposit or loan runoff? I think you said on the lending side that hasn't happened. And any maybe early comments on business synergies between some of the businesses and products that you bring to the table with those new customers?Charles Sulerzyski: Costs are tracking, probably slightly, maybe above where we expected them to be at this point in time. The loans as you indicated are where we thought they would be. Deposits coming back together, we may be in the beginning saw a little bit more run out than we would have. I'm not so sure if it's related to the deal or related to the market situation. And in terms of synergies, with the leasing and the investments and the insurance stuff, I think we see more each passing week as the newer associates become more familiar with what we do and how we do it.Operator: Our next will come from Tim Switzer with KBW.Tim Switzer: Hey, I'm on for Mike Perito. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask a quick follow-up on the net interest margin and your guidance for it to be lower on a full year basis versus '23, and that makes sense given the compression we see. But passing in Q4, you guys are growing loans mid to high single-digits what’s I would assume a lot of help there from the leasing portfolio. Can you help quantify for us like how the NIM -- like the trajectory should look over the course of '24 assuming the Fed holds on to rates? Like how many basis points of expansion do you think we could see over the course of the year?Kathryn Bailey: I mean from a quarterly basis, I think we could see 5 basis points to 10 basis points of expansion from beginning to end on a quarterly basis.Tim Switzer: Like 5 basis points to 10 basis points each quarter?Kathryn Bailey: No, I'd say more in total, so a few basis points each quarter.Tim Switzer: I got you. Q4 over Q4. Okay. That's helpful. And let's say it's a scenario where the Fed cuts rates sometime next year, what -- if this is after deposit costs have settled out from the rate hikes, do you have an idea of kind of like the sensitivity of your balance sheet to that and what NII would look like in that scenario?Kathryn Bailey: Yes, I would say we have positioned our balance sheet to be relatively neutral. We have taken much of the benefit from rising rates into our base case scenario and therefore have hedged on the lower side, predominantly through the investment securities portfolio and what we have put on over the last few quarters.Tim Switzer: Okay. That's helpful. And what are like the economic assumptions you have for your loan growth expectations next year? And which categories should be the leaders and maybe what are the risks of not achieving that, given the macro environment?Charles Sulerzyski: Well, we will still see some growth in real estate as construction projects come to completion, but we will not see as much CRE volume of new business as we have been seeing. We do not see a slowdown in our C&I customers, so we expect to see good C&I growth. Auto will be -- we'll get a few percentage of growth out of it. The leasing businesses are seeing -- as is typical one, you see leasing businesses do better in higher rate environments or slower economic environments and we expect that to continue. We are very optimistic in the ability of our premium financed folks to have good, strong 20-plus percent growth. So it's really a lot of little actions across many different portfolios. We have some opportunities on things like a very large McDonald's franchise lender in the State of Ohio.We'll be able to do that in Kentucky with the acquisition. So a lot of granularity to the portfolio, which we think is great for origination and great for risk management.Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Manuel Navas with D.A. Davidson. You may now go ahead.Manuel Navas: Hey, good morning. Just to get on the -- with your NIM expectations next year, what do you kind of contemplate deposit costs going to, especially if the rate environment stays where they are? Just kind of what are your deposit beta assumptions with it?Kathryn Bailey: Yes, I think historically we've set our deposit betas have run all inclusive, non-interest bearing and otherwise, about 25%. I don't think we have in our projections getting quite to that high, but we definitely have us getting pretty upwards of 18% to 20%.Manuel Navas: What are the CDs coming on at, the kind of the promotional CD rate? And I apologize if you said it during the prepared comments.Kathryn Bailey: Nope, no need to apologize. We didn't say it. Some of the tenors that we've put out there have a 5% handle.Manuel Navas: Okay. Are you seeing -- and you're keeping it pretty short. Are you seeing most of the CD funding coming from current customers? Are you gaining some customers? How are you thinking about that just strategically?Kathryn Bailey: Yes. We're seeing a fair amount of the production in CD specials coming from new clients. Somewhere between 40% and 45% I would say is kind of new money, and maybe -- I guess, maybe not always new clients, but new money to the institution.Manuel Navas: And historically, you have pretty strong metrics that those turn into nice cross-sells and more permanent customers.Kathryn Bailey: Yes, that is the strategy.Manuel Navas: Can you walk me through the earn back on the securities transaction this quarter? It sounded like it was even a faster earn back than you kind of target usually? But it's within a year, right? Or did I misread it a little bit?Kathryn Bailey: So what we did in Q1, so we sold -- I can't remember the volume, $70 million maybe. We saw that equated to about a loss of about $2 million. What we've said -- I guess it was closer to $97 million of balances we sold for about a $2 million loss in the first quarter, and what we stated at that time was that would pay back within the calendar year. So yes, it was less than a year payback on that strategy.Manuel Navas: And you're willing to kind of play around up to 2 years if you see opportunities and the balance sheet needs it?Kathryn Bailey: Correct. And we'll be confident that the securities would stick around for those 2 years to make that earn back hold true.Manuel Navas: Leasing has been in really strong trends. Can you just focus in on that for a moment, just what are your expectations next year? You talked about with higher rates, more folks are interested in leasing. And also just kind of big picture, credit expectations there, just kind of a reset on expectations for that business?Charles Sulerzyski: We have 2 leasing companies. One is a small ticket lease, where the average ticket is about $50,000. The average yield of originations for those leases at this point in time are north of 19%. We see growth in that business. And the second one, which I'll talk about in the second, in the neighborhood of 20-plus percent. Obviously, at 19%, you are pricing in some room for charge-offs. For the last couple of years have been less than 1.5%. Those charge-offs may go as high as 3% to 4% over the next 24 months. But obviously, we're getting well compensated for that. The second leasing business is our Vantage business in Minnesota, the average ticket size there is about $270,000. They have an emphasis or a focus on technology.Many of their clients are publicly traded companies, well positioned school districts, some of the leading hospitals in the country. We expect -- we have had very little charge-off expectation with that business. We expect to have very little charge-off activity in the next 24 months. Their yields are currently on originations in the neighborhood of 9%.Manuel Navas: And there's some seasonality here, right? Is there a seasonality towards the end of the year with those two businesses?Charles Sulerzyski: Seasonality, not -- yes, there's a little bit of seasonality, but not that much that it makes that much of a difference.Manuel Navas: And I'm just making sure I confirm that, 19% yields and 9%, right?Charles Sulerzyski: Yes. More or less.Operator: Our next question will come from Daniel Cardenas with Janney.Daniel Cardenas: I may have missed this, I joined a little bit late here. But on your leasing income for the third quarter, I noticed a significant drop. Can you give us a little bit of color as to what drove that and what's the potential for a bounce back in leasing income in the fourth quarter?Kathryn Bailey: Sure Dan. That relates to the purchase accounting related to the Vantage transaction that we did last year. They have residual values on their books and when we went through purchase accounting, we had to mark those as we have to mark the whole balance sheet to fair value. And so we had to put on a premium related to that portfolio. And as those come to term, we have to realize that premium against any gain that would otherwise be recorded. So that is what you see about $1.8 million -- $1.7 million, $1.8 million premium amortization in the third quarter. In prior quarters, it has not been that significant, but it is choppy on a quarterly basis, just given when those leases kind of come to term.Daniel Cardenas: And then on the credit quality front, good to see some improvement in the nonperformers, but did notice that your 90 days past due were up a bit there. Can you give us some color as to where that was coming from categorically?Charles Sulerzyski: Yes, the majority of that is coming from this small ticket leasing business.Daniel Cardenas: And then how are trends, how are watchlist trends looking for that business?Charles Sulerzyski: Look, the trends in delinquencies are increasing. The charge-off rate, we do expect it to increase. As I mentioned earlier, we've had multiple years with like 1.5% or less charge-off rates. Obviously, at a 19% yield, you're not going to get over a cycle 1% to 1.5% charge-off rates, and we're very comfortable. We frankly price that stuff to a 4.5% charge-off rate. We do not see ourselves getting near that 4.5% charge-off rate. But if it creeps up to the 2s and the 3s, we're perfectly comfortable with that.Daniel Cardenas: And then on the lending front -- thank you for the guidance for 2024. Are there any areas that you're maybe tapping the brakes a little bit on in terms of growing those portfolios? And then how should we be thinking about your provision on a go forward basis?Charles Sulerzyski: How should we be thinking about our provision? We've never been a lover of hotels. We are acquisitive and we pick up hotels and we try to run -- tighten up that space a little bit. That being said, if somebody has built hotel that's cash flowing and good sponsors, we will certainly look at it, but it's not our favorite place to land. But for the most part we're open for business. We think we're benefiting from that. We're seeing some competitors having to pull back because of liquidity issues. At the 86% loan to deposit, we have room. So, we're hoping to see the benefits of that over 2024.Kathryn Bailey: Yes. And as it relates to provision, I think, it's safe to assume that we'll follow what the forecast does. So that to the extent the forecast worsens, we will likely be building reserves. And otherwise, we'll just be reserving on the growth that the rates are kind of at, that you see on as it relates to the coverage ratio.Daniel Cardenas: And then last question, I guess with competitors pulling back somewhat, is that being reflected in current yields?Charles Sulerzyski: I think it'll be more reflected in future yields than current yields. I don't think we've got a ton of books -- a ton of business on our books in the first three quarters from competitors pulling back. We tend to see more and more of that more recently. And I expect that, that will continue.Operator: At this time, there are no further questions. Sir, do you have any closing remarks?End of Q&A:Charles Sulerzyski: Yes. I want to thank everybody for joining our call this morning. Please remember that our earnings release and the webcast of this call will be archived at peoplesbancorp.com under the Investor Relationship section. Thank you for your time and have a great day.Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."

2023-10-27,"ITHACA, N.Y., October 27, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Tompkins Financial Corporation (NYSE American: TMP)Tompkins Financial Corporation (""Tompkins"" or the ""Company"") reported a net loss of $33.4 million for the third quarter of 2023. The quarterly results were negatively impacted by the sale of $429.6 million of available-for-sale debt securities, which resulted in an after-tax loss on the sale of securities of $47.5 million. Though this sale resulted in an operating loss in the third quarter of 2023, the transaction is expected to favorably impact securities revenue in future periods as the securities sold had an average yield of 0.93%, while the proceeds of the sale were largely reinvested into securities with an estimated yield of approximately 5.12%. The weighted average life of the securities purchased and sold was approximately 4.3 years.Tompkins President and CEO, Stephen Romaine, commented, ""During the quarter we elected to proactively reposition the balance sheet which will improve securities revenue and we expect that the improved revenue will exceed the value of the loss recognized in the third quarter through time. We estimate securities revenue to improve by approximately $15.4 million over the next twelve months.While the economic environment remains challenging for the banking industry, our capital and liquidity levels remain healthy and well positioned to meet the needs of our customers. We continued to see favorable growth trends, with annualized loan growth of 6.0% from the second to third quarter of this year and increased deposit balances over the same periods. We are also pleased to announce our cash dividend, which is reflective of our healthy capital position.""Diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2023 were a loss of $2.35, which reflects the impact of the after-tax losses of $3.34 per diluted share related to the sale of available-for-sale debt securities as noted above. Diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2022 were $1.48.Story continuesFor the year-to-date period ended September 30, 2023, net income was a loss of $5.5 million, or a loss of $0.39 per diluted share. Year-to-date results were also negatively impacted by after-tax losses on the sale of securities totaling $52.9 million, or $3.69 loss per diluted share. For the same year-to-date period in 2022, net income was $65.5 million, or $4.53 per diluted share.SELECTED HIGHLIGHTS FOR THE PERIOD:Total loans at September 30, 2023 were up $82.5 million, or 1.5% (6.1% on an annualized basis) compared to the immediate prior quarter, and up $226.4 million, or 4.3%, from September 30, 2022.Total deposits at September 30, 2023 were $6.6 billion, up $168.8 million, or 2.5% (10.4% on an annualized basis) from June 30, 2023, and down $313.3 million, or 4.5%, from September 30, 2022.Loan to deposit ratio was stable at 82.1%, compared to 82.9% for the immediate prior quarter.Regulatory Tier 1 capital to average assets was 9.01% at September 30, 2023, compared to 9.57% at June 30, 2023 and 9.14% at September 30, 2022.Total nonperforming assets at September 30, 2023 represented 0.41% of total assets, which was flat compared to the immediate prior quarter and down from 0.45% at September 30, 2022.NET INTEREST INCOMENet interest income was $51.0 million for the third quarter of 2023, down from $51.9 million for the second quarter of 2023 and $58.1 million for the third quarter of 2022. Net interest margin was 2.75% for the third quarter of 2023, compared to 2.83% reported for the second quarter of 2023 and 3.04% reported for the third quarter of 2022. The decrease in net interest income and net interest margin during the third quarter, when compared to the second quarter of this year and the same quarter last year, was due primarily to the increase in interest rates on interest-bearing liabilities outpacing increases on interest earning asset yields due to the higher interest rate environment.For the year-to-date period ended September 30, 2023, net interest income was $157.2 million, down $15.8 million, or 9.2%, when compared to the same period in 2022.Average loans for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 were up $80.5 million, or 1.5%, from the second quarter of 2023, and were up $200.0 million, or 3.9%, compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2022. The increase in average loans over both prior periods was mainly in the commercial real estate portfolio. The average yield on interest-earning assets for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 was 4.06%, which was up from 3.91% for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, and up from 3.32% for the quarter ended September 30, 2022.Average total deposits for the third quarter of 2023 were down $20.0 million, or 0.3%, compared to the second quarter of 2023, and down $394.4 million, or 5.8%, compared to the same period in 2022. The decrease as compared to the prior year was largely driven by a decline in stimulus funding and a tightening monetary policy that has led to a declining trend in bank deposits on a national level, as reported by the Federal Reserve. The cost of interest-bearing deposits increased to 1.74% for the third quarter of 2023, compared to 1.41% for the second quarter of 2023, and 0.36% for the third quarter of 2022. The cost of interest-bearing deposits for the third quarter of 2023 increased 33 basis points from June 30, 2023. The ratio of average noninterest bearing deposits to average total deposits for the third quarter of 2023 was 31.0% compared to 31.1% for the second quarter of 2023. The average cost of interest-bearing liabilities for the third quarter of 2023 of 1.98%, represents an increase of 34 basis points over the second quarter of 2023, and an increase of 153 basis points over the same period in 2022.NONINTEREST INCOMENoninterest income was a loss of $41.6 million for the third quarter of 2023, which represents a decrease in noninterest income of $62.3 million compared to the third quarter of 2022. Year-to-date noninterest income was a loss of $8.6 million, which represents a decrease in noninterest income of $68.2 million compared to the same nine month period in 2022. The decrease in noninterest income in the third quarter of 2023 was largely due to the above noted sale of available-for-sale debt securities, which resulted in the recognition of a pre-tax loss of $62.9 million. Fee-based revenues, including insurance commissions and fees, wealth management fees, service charges on deposit accounts and card services income, for the third quarter of 2023 were collectively up $543,000, or 2.7%, over the same period in 2022.NONINTEREST EXPENSENoninterest expense was $49.9 million for the third quarter of 2023, which was up $264,000, or 0.5%, over the third quarter of 2022. For the year-to-date period, noninterest expense of $152.0 million was up $6.4 million, or 4.4%, from the same period in 2022. The increase in noninterest expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 over the same period in 2022 was mainly in other operating expenses which were up $4.1 million and higher personnel-related expenses, which were up $2.7 million. Contributing to the growth in other expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to the same period in 2022 were the following: expenses related to the Company’s retirement plans, up $1.3 million; professional fees, up $699,000, New York State minimum tax, up $623,000; and FDIC insurance, up $777,000. The increase in personnel-related expenses was mainly in health insurance, which is up $1.5 million.INCOME TAX EXPENSEThe provision for income taxes was a credit of $8.3 million for an effective rate of 20.0% for the third quarter of 2023, compared to tax expense of $6.8 million and an effective rate of 24.1% for the same quarter in 2022. For the first nine months of 2023, the provision for income taxes was a credit of $619,000 for an effective rate of 10.3% compared to tax expense of $20.1 million and an effective rate of 23.4% for the same period in 2022. The decrease in income tax expense between comparable periods reflects the decrease in pre-tax income, due primarily to the realized losses on the sale of certain available-for-sale securities and the anticipated retention of certain New York State tax benefits.ASSET QUALITYThe allowance for credit losses represented 0.91% of total loans and leases at September 30, 2023, flat as compared to June 30, 2023, and up from 0.86% at September 30, 2022. The ratio of the allowance to total nonperforming loans and leases was 156.96% at September 30, 2023, compared to 154.76% at June 30, 2023 and 128.27% at September 30, 2022.Provision for credit losses for the third quarter of 2023 was $1.2 million compared to $1.1 million for the same period in 2022. Provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $2.6 million, compared to $1.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The increase in provision expense for both the quarter and year-to-date periods was mainly driven by economic forecasts, loan growth, and changes in asset quality. Net charge-offs for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 were $177,000 compared to net charge-offs of $122,000 reported for the same period in 2022.Nonperforming assets represented 0.41% of total assets at September 30, 2023, down from 0.43% at December 31, 2022 and 0.45% reported at September 30, 2022. At September 30, 2023, nonperforming loans and leases totaled $31.4 million, compared to $32.8 million at December 31, 2022 and $34.9 million at September 30, 2022. The increase in loans past due 30-89 days at quarter-end September 30, 2023, was mainly due to the inclusion of two commercial real estate loans to one relationship totaling $18.6 million. The Company believes that the existing collateral securing the loans is sufficient to cover the exposure as of September 30, 2023.Special Mention and Substandard loans and leases totaled $122.9 million at September 30, 2023, reflecting an increase from the $98.3 million reported at December 31, 2022, and $106.7 million at September 30, 2022. The increase as compared to year-end in Special Mention and Substandard was mainly a result of the downgrade of one commercial real estate loan added to Special Mention during the second quarter of 2023 and the downgrade of one commercial real estate loan previously reported as Special Mention in the second quarter of 2023.CAPITAL POSITIONCapital ratios at September 30, 2023 remained well above the regulatory minimums for well-capitalized institutions. The ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets was 13.46% at September 30, 2023, compared to 14.42% at December 31, 2022 and 14.26% at September 30, 2022. The ratio of Tier 1 capital to average assets was 9.01% at September 30, 2023, compared to 9.34% at December 31, 2022 and 9.14% at September 30, 2022.During the third quarter of 2023, the Company repurchased 41,781 common shares at an aggregate cost of $2.3 million. These shares were purchased under the Company's Stock Repurchase Program announced in the third quarter of 2021.LIQUIDITY POSITIONThe Company's liquidity position at September 30, 2023 was stable and consistent with the immediately prior quarter. Liquidity is enhanced by ready access to national and regional wholesale funding sources including Federal funds purchased, repurchase agreements, brokered deposits, Federal Reserve Bank Discount Window advances and Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLB) advances. The Company maintains ready access liquidity of $1.2 billion, or 15.1% of total assets at September 30, 2023. As members of the FHLB, the Company can use certain unencumbered mortgage-related assets and securities to secure borrowings from the FHLB. At September 30, 2023 the Company had an available borrowing capacity at the FHLB of $969.4 million. Through various programs at the Federal Reserve Bank, the Company has the ability to use certain unencumbered mortgage-related assets and securities to secure borrowings from the Federal Reserve Bank's Discount Window. At September 30, 2023 the available borrowing capacity with the Federal Reserve Bank was $91.8 million, secured by investment securities.

2023-10-28,"Independent Bank Corporation (NASDAQ:IBCP) stock is about to trade ex-dividend in 4 days. Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Therefore, if you purchase Independent Bank's shares on or after the 2nd of November, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 13th of November.The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.23 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$0.92 per share to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Independent Bank stock has a trailing yield of around 4.9% on the current share price of $18.92. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! As a result, readers should always check whether Independent Bank has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. View our latest analysis for Independent Bank If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. That's why it's good to see Independent Bank paying out a modest 32% of its earnings.When a company paid out less in dividends than it earned in profit, this generally suggests its dividend is affordable. The lower the % of its profit that it pays out, the greater the margin of safety for the dividend if the business enters a downturn.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. That's why it's comforting to see Independent Bank's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 25% per annum for the past five years.Story continuesMany investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. In the last nine years, Independent Bank has lifted its dividend by approximately 16% a year on average. Both per-share earnings and dividends have both been growing rapidly in recent times, which is great to see.To Sum It UpIs Independent Bank an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? When companies are growing rapidly and retaining a majority of the profits within the business, it's usually a sign that reinvesting earnings creates more value than paying dividends to shareholders. This is one of the most attractive investment combinations under this analysis, as it can create substantial value for investors over the long run. In summary, Independent Bank appears to have some promise as a dividend stock, and we'd suggest taking a closer look at it.With that in mind, a critical part of thorough stock research is being aware of any risks that stock currently faces. For instance, we've identified 2 warning signs for Independent Bank (1 is a bit unpleasant) you should be aware of.A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

(NASDAQ:ASRV) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next four days. The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Accordingly, AmeriServ Financial investors that purchase the stock on or after the 3rd of November will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 20th of November.The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.03 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$0.12 per share to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that AmeriServ Financial has a trailing yield of 4.7% on the current share price of $2.55.

Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. With that in mind, we're not enthused to see that AmeriServ Financial's earnings per share have remained effectively flat over the past five years. We'd take that over an earnings decline any day, but in the long run, the best dividend stocks all grow their earnings per share.Story continuesAnother key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. In the past 10 years, AmeriServ Financial has increased its dividend at approximately 12% a year on average.To Sum It UpIs AmeriServ Financial worth buying for its dividend? AmeriServ Financial's earnings per share have been essentially flat, and the company is paying out more than half of its earnings as dividends to shareholders. All things considered, we're not optimistic about its dividend prospects, and would be inclined to leave it on the shelf for now.With that being said, if you're still considering AmeriServ Financial as an investment, you'll find it beneficial to know what risks this stock is facing. To help with this, we've discovered 3 warning signs for AmeriServ Financial (1 is concerning!) that you ought to be aware of before buying the shares.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

2023-11-01,"iBio, Inc.- ShieldTx potentially increases safety and developability of therapeutic antibodies for difficult targets and modes of action -BRYAN, Texas and SAN DIEGO, Nov. 01, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- iBio, Inc. (NYSEA:IBIO) (“iBio” or the “Company”) today announced the expansion of its AI-powered technology stack with the launch of ShieldTx, a patent-pending antibody masking technology designed to enable specific, highly targeted antibody delivery to diseased tissue without harming healthy tissue. By adding ShieldTx to its Drug Discovery Platform, iBio uniquely integrates antibody engineering and masking in one accelerated process to potentially overcome the challenges of complex targets, safety, and developability in next-generation antibody discovery and development.The Company used ShieldTx to develop masks for its MUC16-targeted bispecific antibody (“Ab”) candidates, which were previously developed using iBio’s patented Epitope Steering and EngageTx™ AI Platforms. MUC16 is a well-known cancer target often overexpressed in several types of solid tumors, including ovarian, lung, and pancreatic cancers.One of the main challenges of therapeutic antibody discovery is drug targets are often expressed on both healthy and diseased tissue, resulting in off-tissue side effects. Scientists are increasingly turning to antibody masking to reduce or eliminate these side effects. Masks deactivate Abs until they encounter a specific enzyme only present in the target diseased tissue. When masked Abs engage with this specific enzyme, the mask is removed, and the antibody is activated. This approach reduces or eliminates off-tissue side effects, enhances the therapeutic safety range, and reduces the risk of an unwanted immune response of bispecific Abs1. In an in vitro laboratory setting, iBio’s specially designed MUC16 bispecific Abs were deactivated and then reactivated, demonstrating successful application of the ShieldTx technology.Traditional masking techniques are complex procedures and require the sequential optimization of antibody and mask. This increases development time and risk by adding more steps to a typically linear development and optimization process.Story continues“Our technology aims to advance antibody masking by fine-tuning both the mask and antibody in tandem using our StableHu™ antibody optimizer and its mammalian display technology,” said Matt Greving, Ph.D., VP & Head of Machine Learning & Platform Technologies at iBio. “This potentially reduces repetitive steps and may significantly boost the probability of success in creating masked antibodies. ShieldTx can be applied to cancer therapeutics, and potentially to autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. iBio intends to use ShieldTx to further optimize its current antibody candidates, particularly the bispecific TROP-2 x CD3 molecules developed using our proprietary T-cell engager antibody panel, EngageTx.”“With 40% of approved antibodies working against just 10 targets2, there is significant potential for therapeutic development against additional new targets; but unfortunately, these targets are often difficult and complex, and require new technologies to optimize antibody discovery and development,” added iBio’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Scientific Officer, Martin Brenner, DVM, Ph.D. “We are rapidly building an integrated end-to-end platform incorporating the most innovative technologies in machine learning, computational biology, and synthetic biology to enable iBio and our partners to craft the next generation of antibody-based therapeutics against difficult targets and modes of action.

2023-11-02,"Shares of Byline Bancorp (BY) have gained 0.1% over the past four weeks to close the last trading session at $19.17, but there could still be a solid upside left in the stock if short-term price targets of Wall Street analysts are any indication. Going by the price targets, the mean estimate of $24.75 indicates a potential upside of 29.1%.The average comprises four short-term price targets ranging from a low of $23 to a high of $26, with a standard deviation of $1.26. While the lowest estimate indicates an increase of 20% from the current price level, the most optimistic estimate points to a 35.6% upside. More than the range, one should note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.While the consensus price target is a much-coveted metric for investors, solely banking on this metric to make an investment decision may not be wise at all. That's because the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable.However, an impressive consensus price target is not the only factor that indicates a potential upside in BY. This view is strengthened by the agreement among analysts that the company will report better earnings than what they estimated earlier. Though a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't give any idea as to how much the stock could surge, it has proven effective in predicting an upside.Here's What You May Not Know About Analysts' Price TargetsAccording to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.While Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?Story continuesThey usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.However, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.That said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.Here's Why There Could be Plenty of Upside Left in BYThere has been increasing optimism among analysts lately about the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher. And that could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. After all, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current year, one estimate has moved higher over the last 30 days compared to no negative revision. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased 2.2%.Moreover, BY currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), which means it is in the top 5% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>Therefore, while the consensus price target may not be a reliable indicator of how much BY could gain, the direction of price movement it implies does appear to be a good guide.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Now at this time, I would like to introduce Jason Serrano, Chief Executive Officer. Jason, please go ahead.Story continuesJason Serrano: Thanks, Christy. Good morning. Welcome to New York Mortgage Trust's Third Quarter Earnings Call. We have been discussing a seismic market shift that has been underway since early 2022. The impact is likely to be far-reaching given historic rate moves and curve inversions. In anticipation of heavy Treasury issuance calendar and continued higher for longer narrative from the Fed, the market witnessed record short positions added in the futures and options market by hedge funds, likely causing the curve to flatten in recent weeks. Home affordability is now at the worst point since the 1970s. And yet earlier this week, Case-Shiller's August HPA showed an increase of 1.01% month-over-month, which is the fifth straight month increase.Low inventory of properties for sale are keeping home value support in the near-term. This trend will continue to keep rental demand strong, particularly in the southern markets where migration is still elevated. Mean reversion to long-term housing affordability would require deflating home prices, lowering mortgage rates, and or increasing incomes. Given that we are likely at the end of a growth cycle, a combination of lower home prices and lower mortgage rates are more likely. Hence, we see that growing a credit portfolio by being a liquidity provider in this market seems to be a highly unattractive proposition at this time. Now, to briefly highlight companies' quarterly results, which Christine will cover in detail, the impact of rate volatilities clearly eroded investor confidence in the quarter, and we are not immune to this reaction.Our adjusted book value declined by 9.71% in third quarter as a result of lower asset value and impairments, particularly within our multifamily joint venture equity portfolio. Despite improvements we are seeing to our top-line revenue for our multifamily properties on balance sheet today, and generally a large cash flow from buyers in the market, there's little urgency being exhibited to transact at this time. Buyers are waiting for interest rate stability to lock in equity returns, and on the flip side, we don't see any evidence of property sales at the wider cap rates either. Not surprisingly, 2023 property transaction volume is 72% below last year, and we're likely to stay depressed in the near term. With limited recourse leverage we utilized through the year and excess liquidity generated, we were able to safely more than double our agency portfolio in the quarter and take advantage of technical pressure which pushed secondary market agency spreads to one of the widest levels ever.Looking at page eight, our defensive posture is a result of signs that the economy is an inflection point. Recent consumer data shows mounting stress at a time when the economy seems to be functioning well. GDP rose at an annual rate of 4.9% in the third quarter. The increase was driven by strong consumer demand, which accounted for more than half of the GDP increase. Consumer spending, as measured by expenditures, increased 4% in the third quarter from 80 base points in the second quarter. Consumers seem to enjoy a bit of a spending splurge at the end of the summer with heavy retailer discounts. The outlook for continued consumer growth to support economic expansion looks unlikely. In fact, when digging deeper into the inputs, Q3 GDP had poor quality results.As you see on page eight, consumer spending was fueled by more debt, which is nearly $1.3 trillion or 20% higher than pre-COVID levels. On this point, for the first time ever, more than 50% of all U.S. credit card holders are rolling debt by making minimum payments rather than paying off balances. And according to Bankrate, this is happening at a time where credit card APR recently hit a record high of 28.3%. Furthermore, while topping out credit cards, U.S. consumers seem to have burned through excess savings as well. The drawdown of savings as a%age of the disposable income went from 5.3% in May to 3.4% in September. One would have to look back 10 years ago to see such a change. With this low savings rate at 50% of historical average, the ability to use credit to spend is looking more unlikely.Change in credit availability has recently become much harder than any time over the past 20 years. With headwinds, the U.S. consumer, the trend of discretionary spending is likely to contract in Q4. Due to how consumption was generated, we do not find the GD print to be impressive, which reinforces our portfolio's management strategy. However, third quarter GDP does line up with similar trends related to contraction in the past, as a 5% GDP print is quite common in the last two quarters before the onset of a recession historically. We recognize that our previous goal to shrink our credit portfolio and maintain asset acquisitions at a minimal pace brings forth a different set of risks, particularly reinvestment risks, to the extent we have misread potential signals for credit contraction.We also recognize we're an outlier for the hybrid credit reach with this downsizing strategy. We do not have much Company here. However, if we have read this correctly, and we believe we have, we should begin to see signs of economic contraction in the near term, likely in the first half of 2024. A 150 base points decline in the 10-year is the average move after a tightening cycle as a fight to safety trend emerges by investors. From our portfolio management decision, staying up in quality and not taking on new leveraged credit is prudent. In this stage, we will continue to proceed cautiously and focus on investments that will outperform in a downturn, pointing to our focus within the non-credit space at this time. On page 9, we explain objectives that have been consistent for over a year.In the near term, the focus on curbing tail risk with respect to our book value by winding down our short-dated portfolio and picking our spots to sell real property opportunistically. Our goal is to keep liquidity high and patiently wait for a period of sustained market dislocation. We believe strong asset management capability will be required to unlock value. This is our strength, and we are excited to leverage our skill set. On the right side of page 9, we show the Company's repositioning timeline. We have well documented this transition of reducing pipelines, downsizing our portfolio by 20% in 2022, and now $1 billion of credit asset reduction year over year. Recently, we were in a unique position to start rebuilding our agency RBS portfolio, which we find very creative.At these higher coupons, as you start the year with zero exposure, Nick will provide more color on this important point. We are seeking higher returns from lending opportunities as we are beginning to see special situations to recapitalize assets and to acquire portfolios of deeply discounted senior loans. As discussed last quarter, a consequence of our defensive posture is that we elected not to replace asset coupons that are paying off from our portfolio, thus also reducing Company earnings, as clearly shown on the bottom right of page 10, the Company's adjusted interest income precipitously declined in the second half of 2022. However, recent allocations to high coupon agency MDS represented in the legend within our other investments increased adjusted interest income by 15% in the quarter to $59.2 million.We still have more work to do here and are finding large opportunities within the agency market, trading at historical wide levels in the secondary market. With $500 million in dry powder equalling 41% of Company market capitalization as of 9-30, we believe we are well positioned for income growth. We're excited about this approach. We can meet our goal to grow income while also staying liquid and protected in the downturn. At this time, I'll pass the call over to Kristine to provide more details about our Q3 financial results. Kristine?Kristine Nario: Thank you, Jason. Good morning. In my comments today, I will focus my commentary on the main drivers of third quarter financial results. Our financial snapshot on slide 12 covers key portfolio metrics for the quarter and slide 26 summarizes the financial results for the quarter. The Company had un-depreciated loss per share of $1.02 in the third quarter as compared to undepreciated loss per share of $0.38 in the second quarter. We had net interest income of $15.8 million, a contribution of $0.19 per share, up from $0.17 per share in the second quarter. Our quarterly adjusted interest income increased to $59.2 million in the third quarter from $51.6 million in the second quarter. The increase is a result of the $946 million investment made in agency RMBS during the quarter, which offsets a decrease in interest income related to continued runoff of our higher yielding short duration BPL bridge loans.The increase in adjusted interest income was offset by $3.6 million increase in adjusted interest expense due to the financing of purchases of agency RMBS during the quarter, offset by the net interest benefit of our in-the-money swaps. Overall, the operations of our consolidated multifamily JV properties contributed a net loss of $0.08 per share during the quarter. Since investing in this asset class, we have disposed of five multifamily joint venture properties, four of which occurred in the second quarter. This resulted in a decrease in both real estate income and expenses by $2.4 million and $2.3 million respectively during the quarter. Also during the quarter, we recognized $44.2 million or $0.49 per share of impairment charges on real estate due primarily to widening cap rates, resulting in lower property valuations as compared to our carrying costs on seven out of the 13 consolidated multifamily properties held for sale.Aerial view of a multi-family property, symbolizing the company's investments.One of our multifamily joint venture properties is currently subject to a purchase sale agreement, and we have been active in marketing our interest in the remaining 14 properties. Although we can provide no assurance of the timing or success of our ultimate exit from these investments, we continue to believe that we can rotate this portfolio over time to more attractive investments through a well-navigated disposition process. The fair value changes related to our investment portfolio continue to have a significant impact on our earnings. During the quarter, we recognized $61.3 million or $0.67 per share of unrealized losses due to lower asset prices on our residential loans and bond portfolio, partially offset by $0.23 per share in gains recognized on our interest rate swaps and caps.We have total G&A expenses of $11.8 million, which decreased compared to the previous quarter due to a decrease in incentive compensation approval and an annual board compensation made in the second quarter. We had portfolio operating expenses of $5.2 million, which decreased primarily due to reduced net servicing fees on our declining BPL bridge portfolio. After significantly curtailing our investment activity for most of 2022 and early in 2023, starting in the second quarter, we began stabilizing our investment portfolio holdings through greater investment activity. And over the course of the past two quarters, we have experienced solid momentum in our portfolio acquisition activities. Our investment portfolio increased by approximately $700 million on a net basis and ended at $4.3 million, $4.7 billion as of 9-30.As Jason mentioned earlier, adjusted book value per share ended at 12.93, down 9.71% from June 30, and translated to a negative 7.61% economic return on adjusted book value during the quarter. The main drivers of adjusted book value change were a $1.04 basic loss per share, our declared dividend of $0.30 per share, and negative $0.11 per share, primarily due to removal of cumulative depreciation and amortization add-backs attributable to consolidated multifamily properties for which impairment was recognized during the quarter. As of quarter end, the Company's recourse leverage ratio and portfolio leverage ratio increased to 1.3 times and 1.2 times respectively, from 0.7 times and 0.6 times respectively as of June 30. While our financing leverage remains low relative to historic levels, the increase in the quarter is primarily due to the financing of newly acquired highly liquid agency RMBS.Despite this, our portfolio recourse leverage ratio on our credit book is unchanged from the previous quarter at 0.3 times. Currently only 52% of our debt is subject to mark-to-market margin calls, of which 40% is collateralized by agency RMBS and 12% collateralized by residential credit assets. The remaining 48% of our debt as of September 30 has no exposure to collateral repricing by our counterparty. Although we expect our leverage to move higher as we expand our agency RMBS holdings, we intend to continue to focus on procuring longer-term and non-mark-to-market financing arrangements for certain parts of our credit portfolio. We paid a $0.30 per common share dividend, unchanged from the prior quarter. We continue to evaluate our dividend policy each quarter and look at the 12 to 18-month projection of not only interest income but also realized or capital gains that can be generated from our investment portfolio.With that said, we note that we expect un-depreciated earnings per share to remain below the current dividend as we continue to rotate excess liquidity into asset acquisitions over the next few months. And with that, I will now turn it over to Nick to go over the market and strategy update. Nick?Nick Ma: Thank you, Christine, and good morning. Over the past two quarters, we have begun to pivot from our defensive posture. As the Fed entered the final chapter of its hiking cycle, we sought to reverse some of the portfolio runoff that we have experienced to date. While we acknowledge that there is still a considerable amount of uncertainty and volatility across markets, and the odds of an economic slowdown are further heightened by geopolitical conflict, we believe that we can prudently grow our portfolio in investments that have the potential to outperform for the long term. We seek to expand our asset base such that we can achieve a higher and more sustainable rate of income generation. We are, however, staying cautious about the potential credit dislocations that may arise in the future.We are being selective about where we invest and remain steadfast on asset management. In the quarter, we substantially increased asset acquisitions, purchasing $1.1 billion of assets, with $946 million of those concentrated in agency MBS. This activity was greater than last year's peak of acquisitions in the second quarter of 2022, before we slowed down our investment pipeline. Away from agencies, our BPL bridge volumes have also grown at $179 million in the quarter from $100 million in the prior quarter. The overall investment portfolio is now $4.7 billion as of the end of the third quarter, up from $4 billion. The conservative positioning that we undertook in 2022 preserved liquidity and allowed for capital return through portfolio pay-downs.This has afforded us the ability to meaningfully scale up investment activity, now with wider yields and spreads available in the market. We continue to favor agency RMBS with its historical wide spreads due to technical headwinds. We are also focused on expanding our investments in BPL bridge, given its high yield and shorter duration. Delving first into agency RMBS. As we mentioned earlier, we have managed to deploy a meaningful amount of capital in the quarter in agency MBS. As spreads, both in ZV and OAS terms, approach the wides of the year. The fence resolved to keep interest rates higher for longer has manifested in a sharp rate move higher at the longer end, with the yield curve steepening and gradually disinverting. As the 10-year treasury rate made a steady march higher towards 5% in the quarter, the market began to contemplate the bond supply impact of rising government interest costs and the sustainability of a worsening budget deficit.This increase in interest rate volatility has weighed on agency MBS spreads. The technical backdrop is also challenging as it is hard to discern who the next marginal buyer of agency MBS will be. Money managers who have been supportive of the market are currently over-weight the sector amidst a challenging quarter for fixed income returns. We see the widespread agencies as an opportunity. And although the near-term technicals may be choppy, we believe that this is a favorable entry point to attractive longer-term returns. Our strategy within agency MBS remains consistent. We seek to invest up in coupon where we see a better spread and carry profile, and we target low pay-up spec pools for additional prepayment protection. We have managed to increase our spec pool average coupon to 5.7% from 5.5% from the prior quarter because of the purchases of higher coupon assets.Overall, the leverage of the agency book is 8.5 times, up from the prior quarter of 7.2 times, primarily due to mark-to-market moves. This is still within a comfortable range where we will run the agency strategy as the credit book on the other side is under levered at a 0.3 times portfolio recourse leverage ratio. We have the ability to rotate capital from our credit strategies and available cash to deploy into agencies where we see ROEs in the high teens. In BPL Bridge, we have been onboarding additional originators to increase our go-forward volumes. Our credit underwriting remains strict as we try to avoid the fringes of the credit box and seek out experienced sponsors with straightforward rehabilitation projects. We also limit small-balance multifamily, large-balance single-family, and ground-up construction loans, all of which have less liquidity and financeability in the market.Given the short-duration nature of these BPL Bridge loans, recent origination volume and coupons have not meaningfully been impacted by the move in longer-term rates. The stability of the BPL Bridge profile amidst this recent volatility further highlights the attractive return potential for the asset class. Relating to the asset management of the portfolio, quarter over quarter, we are pleased to see the net decline in the dollar balance of outstanding delinquencies from $208 million to $202 million, driven by additional resolutions and sales. Our cumulative loss to date in the strategy is five basis points on $3.3 billion of historical BPL Bridge fundings as of quarter end, cash collections of interest, inclusive of ancillary income, continues to be stable at a 95% average of scheduled interest.The portfolio continues to pay down steadily as we expected, leaving only $884 million of UPB as of the end of the third quarter of 2023. We hope to maintain and grow the level of BPL Bridge from this point. Pivoting now to our multi-family mezzanine book, the strong credit performance in our multi-family mezzanine portfolio has been consistent over the prior quarters. There is still only one delinquent loan in the portfolio, with that loan expecting to pay off without a loss. Not only has the credit performance of these assets been stable, the speed of the return of capital has been exemplary. The payoff rate of the mezzanine portfolio was at 32% in 2022 and is at an annualized 35% in 2023 thus far. These payoff rates are meaningfully higher than the average historical payoff rate through time of approximately 27%.These elevated redemption rates are not surprising, despite a more difficult financing environment. The weighted average origination date of our mezzanine loan portfolio is the second quarter of 2021. These are more seasoned loans that have accumulated property value increases over the passage of time, further buttressed by the completion or pending completion of their value-add programs. These assets are ripe for monetization or recapitalization today, with significant incentive for sponsors to tap into the equity growth embedded in these properties. Moving on to our multifamily JV equity portfolio, we continue to make progress on the wind-down of the overall portfolio. We have a property amounting to $5 million of invested capital entering PSA this quarter.Looking forward, market forces may hinder the pace of future sales of JV equity positions. With the recent rate moves, senior financing rates are now pricing at around 6.25% for 10-year agency debt, a marked increase from sub-4% rates the market saw prior to 2022. Higher financing costs have exerted pressure on cap rates, with cap rates moving out by approximately 25 basis points in the third quarter. However, there are some positive tailwinds for our portfolio. On a macro level, the cost of home ownership is 50% more expensive than renting today. And as more consumers are priced out of home ownership, the demand for multifamily rentals will be robust for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, we continue to deliver on CapEx plans that have the potential to improve occupancies at higher rental rates, so the longer timeframes of sales should be offset by NOI growth.Overall, we have completed approximately 65% of the budgeted CapEx plans relating to the disposal group properties and will continue to make progress on this alongside our continued sale efforts. I will now pass it back to Jason for his closing remarks.Jason Serrano: Thanks, Nick. We're using this time to strengthen our resourcing pipelines and target areas where we expect to see opportunity. For example, in primary markets with bridge lending and asset recapitalizations, and within the secondary loan market where we anticipate price discounts. We are well positioned for this opportunity to unlock value with our market-leading asset management team. Now at this time, I'll pass the call over to the operator for investor Q&A.See also 20 Most Popular Liquor Brands in America and 20 Most Dog Friendly Cities in the US.To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here."

2023-11-05,"Ares Commercial Real Estate Corporation (NYSE:ACRE) Q3 2023 Earnings Call Transcript November 3, 2023Ares Commercial Real Estate Corporation beats earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $0.25, expectations were $0.23.Operator: Good morning. Welcome to Ares Commercial Real Estate Corporation's Third Quarter September 30, 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on Friday, November 3, 2023. I will now turn the call over to your host, Mr. John Stilmar, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.John Stilmar: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's conference call. I'm joined today by our CEO, Bryan Donohoe; our CFO, Tae-Sik Yoon and other members of the management team. In addition to our press release and the 10-Q that we filed with the SEC, we've posted an earnings presentation under the Investor Resources section of our website at www.arescre.com.

Many of these forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as anticipate, believe, expects, intends, will, should, and similar such expressions.These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations of market conditions and management's judgment.

The company's actual results could differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those listed in its SEC filings. Ares Commercial Real Estate assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. During this conference call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. We use these measures of operating performance, and these measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.Story continuesThese measures may not be comparable to like title measures by other companies. Now I'd like to turn the call over to our CEO, Bryan Donohoe.Bryan Donohoe: Thanks, and good morning, everyone. During the third quarter, we continued to execute on three primary goals we have discussed previously. First, we intended to maintain strong levels of liquidity and moderate leverage. Secondly, we wanted to take advantage of the lending market and our liability structure to selectively originate new loans that would be accretive to our earnings. And finally, we wanted to continue to maximize the value of our underperforming assets. In general, we are pleased with the progress we have made executing against these goals. With respect to the portfolio, we experienced general stability in credit performance as our level of defaults and the universe of risk rated 4 and 5 loans modestly declined quarter-over-quarter.While the benefit of today's rate environment has served to enhance our net interest income, the impact of the higher for longer interest rate environment has resulted in greater economic uncertainty and further headwinds to commercial real estate values. This higher cost of capital is also leading to dramatic reductions in new construction, which we ultimately believe will result in favorable supply dynamics and drive support for commercial real estate fundamentals and values in the future. Specific to ACRE, we believe our deliberate approach of operating with moderate leverage while still generating attractive earnings is the best strategy for navigating today's market. We believe the strength of our balance sheet and capabilities of the broader Ares platform gives us a distinct advantage in addressing our underperforming investments as well as selectively investing in today's attractive lending market.Now let me spend some time discussing some of the actions we took this quarter and our approach in maximizing value of our underperforming loans. This quarter, we foreclosed on the $83 million loan collateralized by a mixed-use facility located in Florida. This loan is now held as REO on our balance sheet. As a reminder, this is an office and retail mixed-use property in Tallahassee that is over 90% leased and continues to generate cash flow that is roughly equivalent to the interest income we earned as a loan. 100% of the office space is leased to a AAA-rated tenant that has approximately a nine-year weighted average lease term remaining. The retail space is also well leased with approximately 85% occupancy and a weighted average term of about seven years.This is where we, at Ares, will continue to actively manage the property with the aim of pushing retail occupancy even higher. It's important to point out that we did not recognize an impairment when foreclosing on the property and currently hold the property unlevered. As one of the leading value add and opportunistic real estate managers, the capabilities at Ares support our ability to own and execute this business plan. Given our balance sheet position, strong operational capabilities and the cash flow profile of the property, we are optimistic about the long-term value of this asset. We also exited a $35 million hospitality loan through a discounted loan payoff this quarter. Given the volatile cash flow profile of this property, the capital required to complete the business plan as well as our view of the future value, we believe it was in ACRE's best interest to exit the loan and redeploy this capital into higher-earning investments.As both of these loans illustrate, our platform capabilities and balance sheet position allow us to take unique strategies to each asset with the goal of maximizing value. Our balance sheet position also allows us to opportunistically invest in today's market. We remain focused on financing strong performing property classes with secular demand drivers, such as industrial, multifamily and self-storage. For example, this past quarter, we originated a $58 million senior loan backed by a newly built Class A multifamily property located in Cincinnati, Ohio that is 95% leased. This property is well located in an affluent part of the city with compelling local supply and demand dynamics. We financed this property at historically lower levels of loan-to-value, modestly wider spreads and reset property valuations.A real estate investor inspecting a property, illustrating the bank's portfolio of mortgages and real estate investments.Looking forward into the fourth quarter and year-end, we expect to make further progress on reducing our exposure to office loans. Through a combination of principal paydowns and exits, we are targeting more than $70 million in outstanding principal balance of office loans to be cleared out in the fourth quarter, but that may well extend into the first quarter of next year. With that, Tae-Sik, let's walk through some of our financial highlights and further details on our portfolio and capital position.Tae-Sik Yoon: Thank you, Bryan, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter of 2023, we reported GAAP net income of $9.2 million or $0.17 per common share. Our GAAP net income was impacted by a $3.2 million net increase in our CECL provision or about $0.06 per common share. Distributable earnings for the third quarter of 2023 was $13.5 million or $0.25 per common share, which was impacted by the $4.9 million or $0.09 per common share realized loss on the defaulted hospitality loan that was resolved in the third quarter. Turning to our portfolio. We ended the quarter with a diversified portfolio of 49 loans held for investment with an outstanding principal balance of $2.2 billion, 98% of which were senior loans. During the third quarter, we received $48 million of total loan repayments, including $25 million of proceeds from the hospitality loan as well as loans backed by self-storage and industrial properties that were repaid at par.In terms of credit quality metrics, 78% of our loan portfolio had a risk rating of 3 or better, which improved from 74% in the second quarter. The improvement was driven by the reduction of our risk rated 4 and 5 rated loans as two such loans were either resolved or converted to REO. During the third quarter, no new loans originated from a risk rating 3 to a risk rating of 4 or 5 in the quarter. We did downgrade one office loan from a 4 to a 5 risk rating with a total unpaid principal balance of $33 million and established a specific reserve of $14.4 million. Inclusive of this specific reserve, we increased our overall CECL reserve by net $3.2 million in the third quarter of 2023. Our total CECL reserve now stands at $116 million or about 5.25% of our outstanding principal balance.Let me provide some further details around the components of our $116 million CECL reserve, which equates to $2.14 per common share total reserve and impacted our book value per common share of $12.62 as of September 30, 2023. As previously mentioned, we have specific reserves of $55 million, representing 61% of the $90 million in outstanding principal balance on the two risk rated five loans. Of the remaining $61 million of reserves, $46 million is accrued against $388 million in outstanding principal balance of risk rated 4 loans, which equates to approximately 12% of the total risk rated 4 loan balance and compares to 10% in the quarter prior. The final $15 million of our total reserve is held against the $1.7 billion of loans rated 3 or better for an average reserve ratio of about 86 basis points of loans held for investment with a risk rating of 3 or better.While the market remains challenged, we believe that our CECL reserve level appropriately takes into account current market conditions and the macroeconomic outlook for our loans held for investment as of September 30, 2023. With respect to the $57 million office loan that is risk rated 5, we continue to be on target to resolve this property, which will result in approximately a $41 million realized loss in the fourth quarter of 2023 or possibly first quarter of 2024. As Bryan referenced earlier, we maintained significant liquidity and moderate net debt-to-equity ratio of 2.0 at quarter end. At quarter end, we had over $130 million in cash and amounts available for us to draw under our working capital facility. In addition, we are holding our REO unlevered, which we believe can be financed to further increase our liquidity.Finally, we declared our fourth quarter dividend of $0.33 per share. So with that, let me turn the call back over to Bryan for some closing remarks.Bryan Donohoe: Thank you, Tae-Sik. While a higher for longer rate environment will extend this cycle and will likely present unforeseen challenges, we believe it will also present some highly attractive investment opportunities. Our moderate leverage and healthy level of liquidity positions us well to navigate these dynamics and ultimately deliver attractive shareholder returns. As always, we appreciate you joining our call today, and we'd be happy to open the line for questions.

In the third quarter of 2023, our battery business generated revenues of $44.33 million, soaring by 71.51% year-over-year. Compared to the operating loss recorded in the same period last year during this quarter, we delivered on operating income of $7.58 million, a net income of $7.77 million, which was 6.3 times that of the same period last year. Of these revenues $42.81 million came from batteries using energy storge applications, a surge of 73.5% year-over-year , while $0.4 million came from batteries used in electric vehicles, an increase of 19.5 times year-over-year.Moreover, revenues from batteries using light electric vehicles were $1.11 million, down 2.8% year-over-year. For the first nine months of 2023, our battery business generated revenues of $96.16 million, an increase of 44.43% year-over-year, while delivering an operating income of $6.15 million, along with a net income of $6.75 million. The growth across our financial metrics was primarily attributed to our strong foundation of key clients, particularly high value clients from Europe and US. Orders from these clients have demonstrated exceptional stability and sustainability. We are confident in sustaining robust performance and profit growth in the upcoming reporting periods. Today, the market still faces various external pressures and challenges including the global economy slowdown.We are proud to stand out as one of the few Chinese battery manufacturers achieving record growth and profitability amidst the current macro economy environment. Our remarkable performance have garnered substantial interest from equity investors who have reached out to us regarding our latest developments. [Foreign Language] Let me share a more detailed update on our business initiatives during the third quarter. With our increased visibility and enhanced reputation worldwide, our order volume continued to rise. As of November 1, 2023, we have recorded approximately RMB900 million in the combined value of orders we have received but have yet to fulfill across our two main battery production facilities based in Dalian and Nanjing. Currently, orders for the Dalian facility have been scheduled toward the end of 2024 and our Nanjing facility is also overwhelmed.Incoming orders from new clients will be subject to further scheduling. In other words, both our revenue and profitability will maintain robust growth momentum over an extended horizon. [Foreign Language] Regarding client initiatives already announced, as of November the 1st, 2023, our collaboration with PowerOak, the world’s leading portable power station manufacturer and parent company of top rated portable power supply brand, BlueTTI, has provided us more than totaling around RMB43.2 million. We also made great strides in our partnership with JinPeng Group, the largest manufacturer of scooters and electric tricycles worldwide generating orders amounting to roughly RMB63.59 million. In addition, I want to highlight our continued initiatives with Viessmann Group, a leading European manufacturer of heating and cooling systems.Our productive collaborations has translated into orders totaling up to EUR116.5 million from the beginning of 2023 to November the 1st. Another major partner of ours is Anker Innovations, one of the largest third-party accessory suppliers globally for Apple Incorporated’s products. Following our signing in September, we have received orders from Anker Innovations amounting to RMB58.35 million. It is understood that Anker Innovations will spur significant demand for our batteries and is expected to place monthly orders on a continued basis. Furthermore, I want to highlight the fact that we have been into discussions regarding various operations including providing products and posts with several major customers from Europe and the US. We will keep our investors informed of any significant updates.A close up image of a technician changing a battery cell in a lithium-based battery.[Foreign Language] With a focus on meeting prime clients with scale about investment in production capacity and R&D, in the third quarter of 2023, both our Dalian and Nanjing facilities have reached a production capacity of one gigawatt hour. Our subsidiary Dalian CBAK power is currently engaged in the development of model 46115 and model 46157 lithium batteries, which are new to the market and larger than the current market favorite model 46800 with higher energy density and an extended lifespan, these new models are ideal for large-scale energy storage scenarios. Our R&D team is diligently driving these initiatives forward and we expect to have the capacity to mass produce the model 46115 batteries next year. In the long-term plans, we will expand the production capacity for the series 46 batteries to 15 gigawatt hours at the Dalian facility, achieving further supply ramp up.In the meantime, the construction of our Nanjing Phase 2 project has been in full swing. The factory rule has been completed which enables six gigawatt hours of production capacity in the first stage. And we expect this production to have ability to be delivered fully equipped and operational soon. Hence I wish to highlight that we will have great to offer long capacity next year to address the current overwhelming current demand. We will elevate our production expectancy and further propel top line growth. [Foreign Language] Finally, and importantly, let me walk you through our mass production of sodium ion batteries. As the only company in China capable of mass producing sodium ion batteries, we have engaged in extensive discussions with multiple investors on building a sodium ion battery plant.In the near future, we expect to finalize a substantial amount of private equity financing to expertise the development of our sodium ion battery plant with the target production capacity of 10 gigawatt hours with the accelerated industrial adoption of sodium ion batteries, we believe it will become a pivotal focus across various sub-sectors such as electric scooters, low speed vehicles, energy storage power stations and household energy storage solutions. Looking ahead, the company will be empowered by a twin engine growth model, an impressive 36 gigawatt hour production capacity of lithium batteries and a remarkable 10 gigawatt hour production capacity of sodium ion batteries matrix. We look forward to collaborating with our investors and partners to advance the evolution of the new energy structure and environmental protection technologies.[Foreign Language] Now, let me turn the call over to our CFO, Thierry Li who will provide details on our financial performance.Thierry Li: Thank you, Mr. Li and thank you everyone for joining our call today. I will now go over our key financial results for the third quarter of 2023. For the full details of our financial results, please refer to our earnings press release. As the battery business returned to year-over-year growth in the third quarter, we also recorded ongoing improvements in gross margin and operating profit margin. This was underpinned by a sharp increase in the contribution of our higher margin battery business and a reduction in the cost of revenues as we further leveraged our technology to improve production efficiency. Alongside growing number of orders for our battery products, we will continue to find the right balance between growth and profitability, while investing in R&D and production capacity expansion to enhance our sustainable long-term competitiveness.Turning to our financial performance. Our net revenue for the third quarter was $63.4 million, representing an increase of 9.9%, compared to $57.7 million in the same period of 2022. This increase was primarily attributable to the growth in the company's battery business. In addition, our net revenue from batteries in the third quarter was $44.3 million, representing a strong growth of 71.5% from the same period in 2022. Our gross margin for the battery business in the third quarter was 26.4%, an increase of 17.7 percentage points from 8.7% in the same period of 2022. The cost of revenues in the third quarter was $51.2 million, representing a decrease of 5.7% from $54.3 million in the same period of 2022. The decrease in the cost of revenues corresponds to the company’s higher gross profit from the battery segment.Gross profit in the third quarter was $12.2 million, representing an increase of 264% from $3.5 million in the same period of 2022. Gross margin in the third quarter was 19.3%, compared to 6% in the same period of 2022. Our total operating expenses in the third quarter rose by 40.8% to $7 million.

2023-11-11,"Generally, when a single insider buys stock, it is usually not a big deal. However, when several insiders are buying, like in the case of Great Southern Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:GSBC), it sends a favourable message to the company's shareholders.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for Great Southern Bancorp The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Great Southern BancorpThe Independent Director Steven Edwards made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$100k worth of shares at a price of US$48.72 each. That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at around the current price of US$50.55. That means they have been optimistic about the company in the past, though they may have changed their mind. If someone buys shares at well below current prices, it's a good sign on balance, but keep in mind they may no longer see value. Happily, the Great Southern Bancorp insiders decided to buy shares at close to current prices.Over the last year, we can see that insiders have bought 3.05k shares worth US$152k. On the other hand they divested 1.05k shares, for US$65k. Overall, Great Southern Bancorp insiders were net buyers during the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below.

So take a peek at this free list of growing companies with insider buying.Insider OwnershipLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Great Southern Bancorp insiders own about US$156m worth of shares (which is 26% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Great Southern Bancorp Tell Us?The fact that there have been no Great Southern Bancorp insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. But insiders have shown more of an appetite for the stock, over the last year. Judging from their transactions, and high insider ownership, Great Southern Bancorp insiders feel good about the company's future. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing.

2023-11-16,"Church & Dwight Co., Inc. CHD has been benefiting from the favorable consumer demand for its brands. The company’s regular innovation, product introductions and acquisitions have helped it curate a solid portfolio. Brand strength, efficient pricing and productivity gains have been working well for Church & Dwight amid cost inflation and high SG&A expenses.These aspects were evident in CHD’s third-quarter 2023 results, wherein the top and bottom lines beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate, and sales increased year over year. In its earnings release, management stated that it expects to witness solid operating fundamentals. Let’s delve deeper.Buyouts & Innovation Boost Portfolio StrengthChurch & Dwight, which started with only one brand, ARM & HAMMER, has acquired several top high-margin brands over the years that have been contributing to its top-line growth. The company recently completed its latest buyout of the Hero Mighty Patch brand (or Hero) and other acne treatment products. In December 2021, CHD concluded the buyout of TheraBreath, which marks the company's 14th power brand. THERABREATH mouthwash and the HERO brand delivered impressive consumption growth and grew market share in the third quarter of 2023.Church & Dwight has been focused on product innovation to propel growth. The company has been differentiating its brands to consumers through innovative products, packaging and forms. On its third-quarter earnings call, Church & Dwight stated that it launched the ARM & HAMMER Power Sheets laundry detergent online.The company also launched ARM & HAMMER Hardball, aimed at capturing a greater share of the lightweight litter category. Moreover, the TROJAN brand is building on the success of the Raw franchise by offering the new TROJAN Raw Non-Latex condom.Management further highlighted that the THERABREATH brand has extended operations to the kids’ category with the launch of three new fluoride types of mouthwashes. The NAIR brand has introduced Prep & Smooth, a one-step solution that preps the face for makeup application in a No-Touch, No-Mess format. The company’s HERO brand remains focused on undertaking innovation in the acne treatment arena.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPricing Actions Aid, Online Sales GrowChurch & Dwight resorted to incremental pricing across its portfolio to counter rising costs. Favorable pricing remained an upside to the company’s organic sales in the third quarter of 2023. Organic sales increased 4.8% due to gains from volumes to the tune of 2.7%, and a favorable product mix and pricing of 2.1%. Another factor working for CHD is the online channel. The company’s global online sales continued to grow in the third quarter. Global online sales, as a percentage of total consumer sales, stood at 17%.For 2023, organic sales growth is likely to be almost 5%. For the fourth quarter of 2023, organic sales are estimated to rise nearly 4%.Cost Headwinds LingerAlthough compensated by pricing, volumes and productivity gains, Church & Dwight’s gross margin was partly hurt by manufacturing cost inflation in the third quarter of 2023. For 2023, the company expects elevated manufacturing costs to the tune of nearly $120 million.Church & Dwight has been witnessing increasing marketing and SG&A expenses for the past few quarters. The company has been undertaking increased marketing to fuel brand awareness, especially for new products and acquired brands.  Management continues to expect increased SG&A expenses in 2023, both on a dollar basis and as a percentage of sales. The expected increase in SG&A can be attributed to additional R&D investments and elevated incentive compensation, among other factors.Management expects marketing as a percentage of net sales to be 11% in 2023, reflecting an increase from 10% in 2022. Church & Dwight expects SG&A expenses and marketing costs to increase considerably year over year in the fourth quarter of 2023. Though the company expects gross profit expansion in the fourth quarter and full year 2023, high SG&A expenses and elevated marketing spend are likely to affect the EPS.Wrapping UpStrong consumer demand encouraged Church & Dwight to raise its sales guidance for 2023 during its last earnings release. The company now expects reported sales growth of nearly 9%, up from the 8% growth projected earlier. Management expects volumes to gain from marketing investments, product innovations and effective execution during the back half of the year.The full-year adjusted operating profit is anticipated to increase nearly 8%. Management anticipates adjusted EPS of $3.15 in 2023, which implies growth of 6% from the year-ago period quarter. For the fourth quarter of 2023, Church & Dwight expects a nearly 5% increase in reported sales. Management expects adjusted EPS of 63 cents for the quarter, indicating a 2% increase from the year-ago quarter’s figure.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have rallied 15.1% year to date compared with the industry’s growth of 2.3%.3 Solid Staple PicksLamb Weston LW, which offers frozen potato products, currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

However, it only increased shareholding by a small percentage, and it wasn't a huge purchase by absolute value, either. View our latest analysis for Sleep Number The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Sleep NumberIn fact, the recent purchase by Stephen Macadam was the biggest purchase of Sleep Number shares made by an insider individual in the last twelve months, according to our records. That implies that an insider found the current price of US$10.67 per share to be enticing. While their view may have changed since the purchase was made, this does at least suggest they have had confidence in the company's future. We do always like to see insider buying, but it is worth noting if those purchases were made at well below today's share price, as the discount to value may have narrowed with the rising price. In this case we're pleased to report that the insider purchases were made at close to current prices.Over the last year, we can see that insiders have bought 52.50k shares worth US$510k.

I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. It appears that Sleep Number insiders own 4.8% of the company, worth about US$11m.

2023-11-18,"The board of Auburn National Bancorporation, Inc. (NASDAQ:AUBN) has announced that it will pay a dividend of $0.27 per share on the 26th of December. This makes the dividend yield 5.2%, which will augment investor returns quite nicely. See our latest analysis for Auburn National Bancorporation Auburn National Bancorporation's Payment Expected To Have Solid Earnings CoverageA big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained.Auburn National Bancorporation has established itself as a dividend paying company with over 10 years history of distributing earnings to shareholders. Taking data from its last earnings report, calculating for the company's payout ratio shows 38%, which means that Auburn National Bancorporation would be able to pay its last dividend without pressure on the balance sheet.Looking forward, earnings per share could rise by 4.5% over the next year if the trend from the last few years continues. If the dividend continues on this path, the future payout ratio could be 38% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendAuburn National Bancorporation Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $0.84 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $1.08. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 2.5% a year over that time. While the consistency in the dividend payments is impressive, we think the relatively slow rate of growth is less attractive.Dividend Growth May Be Hard To AchieveInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. Earnings have grown at around 4.5% a year for the past five years, which isn't massive but still better than seeing them shrink. While EPS growth is quite low, Auburn National Bancorporation has the option to increase the payout ratio to return more cash to shareholders.Story continuesWe Really Like Auburn National Bancorporation's DividendOverall, we think that this is a great income investment, and we think that maintaining the dividend this year may have been a conservative choice. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. For instance, we've picked out 1 warning sign for Auburn National Bancorporation that investors should take into consideration.

2023-11-19,"In this article, we discuss top 30 dividend champions according to dividend yields. You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read Dividend Champions List Ranked By Yield: Top 10. Dividend champions are companies that have increased their dividends for 25 years or more. They share this feature with dividend aristocrats, but the big difference is that dividend champions might not be in the S&P 500, while dividend aristocrats have to be part of it. Setting aside that distinction, what really stands out about these stocks is their consistent track record of giving shareholders more in dividends for a long time.According to a report by ProShares, over time, companies that grow their dividends have done better than the overall S&P 500. They have also given steady income growth across different types of markets and industries. The ability of these companies to generate steady cash flows and increase dividends regularly has contributed to their outperformance, showcasing their resilience and financial strength even during market fluctuations. The report further mentioned that since its inception, the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index has consistently beaten the S&P 500 while being less prone to big swings. For example, if you invested $10,000 in May 2005, by March 2023, it could have grown to over $61,000. This index has shown strength in both good and tough market times, capturing about 91% of the good times and 80% during downturns. When the market took a hit in 2022, it stood strong, performing over 12% better than the S&P 500. Impressively, during the ten worst times the market dropped since 2005, this index outperformed the S&P 500 in eight of them, showcasing its resilience during rough patches.Also read: 12 Best Dividend Aristocrats with Over 3% YieldWhen investing in dividend stocks, investors often focus on dividend yields. However, experts suggest looking more at dividend growth stocks instead of just falling for high yields that might not be sustainable. Eagle Asset Management referred to the historical data and mentioned that indexes of dividend-paying companies usually perform better than the broader market, except for a couple of times when the S&P High Dividend Index significantly lagged behind the S&P 500. This difference might be because companies in the High Dividend Index prioritize paying out a lot of their profits as dividends, which limits their ability to reinvest in growth. When things get tough, the market worries about whether these companies can keep up with high dividends and tends to punish them if they cut or stop paying dividends. On the other hand, companies that focus on increasing their dividends often pay out less of their profits and reinvest more in their businesses. This strategy helps them maintain stability during challenging times, avoiding significant sell-offs.Story continuesAltria Group Inc. (NYSE:MO), Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc.

Jeff?Jeffrey Peck: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to share an update on iSun's continuing robust progress in the third quarter of 2023 and review our plans and expectations for the remainder of this year. Once again, we are very pleased with the strong performance our team has generated this quarter. In the third quarter of 2023, we have produced another beat on the top line with revenues up 47% year-over-year, nicely above the Street's consensus. Despite some of the macroeconomic challenges in our sector, we continue to do precisely what we said we would do. Scale the business, grow revenues and reduced our losses by focusing on efficiencies while we serve our existing customers and win new business.Story continuesOur commercial and industrial group is driving excellent results, and our residential group, SunCommon continues to see high customer satisfaction and referrals despite a short-term slowdown in residential demand, as I'll discuss shortly. Meanwhile, we are seeing continued opportunities in the EV infrastructure segment and our origination team is helping to ensure that we continue to build backlog to sustain that growth. Our success in winning significant new contracts in solar and EV infrastructure as well as more residential business despite some of the headwinds in that segment provides us with heightened confidence in our ability to meet the annual financial targets that we shared earlier and are affirming today for annual revenue growth and improving profitability.We remain dedicated to executing our strategic plan to achieve our mission to help accelerate the adoption of solar energy. Today I want to touch on a few points that underscore why iSun is following a different path in the solar energy industry and what has been driving our recent success. I also want to share some thoughts on some trends we are seeing and why we believe we are well positioned for continued growth as we continue to scale our business. As I said before, it starts with our platform approach, encompassing the full lifecycle of providing solar energy solutions from origination and development to construction and management across business segments. We maintain that this approach is a competitive differentiating advantage that positions us for long-term sustainable growth.We see the proof of the success of the strategy and execution in the meaningful year-over-year revenue growth we have generated this year and on a year-to-date basis. We have increased revenues by 39% compared to the same period in 2022. And as you'll hear us point out repeatedly, we generated this robust growth while reducing our operating expenses over the same period by $5.6 million or 21%. We're very proud of the success we're having from the efficiency measures that we've implemented. Quickly reviewing our third quarter results, revenue increased by 47% to $27.9 million, and gross margin rose 45 basis points to 19.45%, up from 19% in 2022 third quarter. As our efficiency efforts enabled more of the top line to drop to the bottom line. In the third quarter 30% of our revenues came from the residential segment where gross margins tend to be higher, which added pressure to margin expansion.We remain confident that as we scale and drive synergies and efficiency throughout the organization, our margins will expand even though there will be some variability in any given quarter depending on the revenue mix. As of September 30, 2023, our total backlog remained at $161.8 million and our pipeline remained at 1.6 gigawatts of projects as of the end of third quarter of 2023. The size of the backlog and pipeline underscore the healthy customer demand we're experiencing as well as the effectiveness of our efforts to originate more projects and expand to more states, all part of our ongoing strategic initiatives. Our success also reflects a high level of customer satisfaction, specifically in the residential segment, which generates strong referrals, creating a lower customer acquisition cost.We see the same positive referral impact in our C&I group. I'll provide some more details about one of our new partnerships with Cleantech industry resources momentarily. Let me share a few words about the performance of our 3 divisions in the past quarter. The residential division did well despite the backdrop of a more sluggish residential segment across the industry, reflecting the impact of higher interest rates on home improvement loans. The third silver lining here I would note is that the sticker shock consumers had initially experienced when looking at home improvement loans has abated somewhat. People now know what to expect. There continues to be strong interest in residential solar in our markets, and I will note that because we aren't exposed to the California market like most of our peers were somewhat insulated from the additional residential market challenges.We continue to build more business and expect a heavier period of installations in the coming quarter. The commercial and industrial division, which we combined as of the beginning of 2023 has continued to generate very strong results this year and accounted for 67% of our revenue in the third quarter. Our origination team has become more involved in this effort, focused on initiating projects that have then turned over to the C&I division to execute. We are continuing to work through our backlog while adding more business to the backlog through contract wins. Based on the results we've seen thus far, including enhancing our labor utilization and a reduction in operating expenses, as I mentioned, we remain certain that the decision to combine the commercial and industrial segments was a good one.Our utility and development division continue to face delays, once again something we see across the industry. Although we continue to increase the backlog the group is addressing, and we saw small revenue growth in this past quarter compared to prior quarters in 2023. Despite these product delays or unexpected implementation, we continue to believe the projects will move forward beginning late this year, enabling resulting revenues to be recognized later this year or in early 2024. The development and engineering team has provided invaluable support to our residential and C&I divisions as we continue to integrate and drive and operating efficiencies throughout the organization. Beginning in 2024, we will consolidate our utility and development divisions into our commercial and Industrial team.This consolidation will allow us to capitalize on additional synergies and continue to focus on costs, reduction, and containment. Our team has proven expertise and knowledge of the industry, which is incredibly valuable at these volatile times. This creates a strong customer relationship, leading to contract awards across our business. In the third quarter, we added 27 million in new business, bringing our total for the first 9 months of 2023 to $67 million. Despite sector challenges, we've approached our business with relentless innovation, one of our recent partnerships exemplifies this style of operation. Cleantech Industry Resources, or CIR, is a highly automated provider of energy, project development and engineering services. By collaborating, we could focus on expanding our core turnkey EPC business in conjunction with CIR's growing development as a service and engineering services business.By working together, we reduce any conflicts of interest with many of our developer partners. We also can access CIR's ultra-low-cost services at platform on a preferred basis, while retaining construction rights to all of CIR's internally developed and owned projects. Plus, we also secured preferred partner status on CIR's growing pipeline of EPC related projects, which is currently estimated at 5.25 gigawatts. This will fuel our project backlog for years to come. We look forward to sharing more information about this collaboration as we move forward together. In terms of the solar landscape, we remain optimistic and enthusiastic. As I mentioned, our C&I segment is scaling nicely, responding effectively to increase customer demand with expanded teams while ensuring that our labor utilization is optimized.Customer demand continues to increase across the country directly and through partners. We continue to secure more opportunities to bid on meaningful projects. The residential segment has been sluggish as I described, but our diversified model allows to deploy our internal resources more efficiently across segments during these challenging times. And the good news is that we have ample backlog to execute in this segment and operate in markets insulated by some of the larger headwinds. Our origination team is producing more opportunities that will eventually be executed largely by our C&I segment, and the Utility and Development division continues to push projects forward and provide valuable services throughout the organization. We remain convinced that both the heightened interest in alternative energy as well as the IRA legislation passed inflation past last year will afford Iceland and the industry genuine benefits.We continue to expect that more specific rules and the removal of uncertainty will increase the value of solar assets, those in development as well as those under construction, which in our case will lead to a higher valuation of our pipeline as it spurs increased demand that we will address in 2024 and beyond. In 2023, considering all the evolving macroeconomic factors, we have continued to demonstrate strong revenue growth and reduce operating expenses, both of which will help us attain operating profitability in the years ahead and sustain our margin expansion. Thus, we are affirming our expectations for total revenue in fiscal year 2023 of between $95 million and $100 million, reflecting a 24% to 31% increase over the total revenue in 2022, along with gross margin expansion on an annual basis.With that, I'll turn the floor over to John.John Sullivan : Thank you, Jeff. We are pleased with the sustained robust revenue growth we produced yet again in the third quarter as we continue to execute on our backlog. I'll provide an overview of our statement of operations as well as provide details on our segments before turning to the balance sheet. iSun reported third quarter 2023 revenue of $27.9 million, up 47% from Q3 2022 revenue of $19 million. For the first 9 months of 2023, revenue was $70.3 million, representing a $19.7 million or a 39% increase over the same period in 2022. Revenue growth in the quarter and year-to-date was driven by effective execution of our commercial and industrial backlog as well as fulfillment of our residential consumer demand. As Jeff mentioned, in the third quarter of 2023, 30% of our total revenues were in the residential segment, which impacted our margin expectations as historically, 50% of our total revenues were in the residential segment.While we continue to execute against our existing backlog, we also generated new demand and added $27 million in new business during Q3 for a total of $67 million added so far in 2023, effectively replenishing the revenue earned year-to-date. Total backlog was $161.8 I'm as of September 30, 2023. By segment, our Residential division generated revenue of $8.3 million and $24.5 million in the third quarter and year-to-date respectively. Customer orders of approximately $15 million are expected to be completed within 3 to 5 months. Our Commercial and Industrial division which were consolidated as of January 1, 2023 generated revenue of $18.8 million and $44.7 million in the third quarter and year-to-date, respectively. The division has contracted backlog of approximately $140.3 million expected to be completed within 10 to 18 months.Our Utility and Development division generated $0.9 million and $1.2 million in the third quarter and year-to-date, respectively. The Utility division had the contracted backlog of approximately $6.5 million and 1.6 gigawatts of projects, currently under development expected to achieve NTP in early 2024. Gross profit in the third quarter was $5.4 million, up 50% from 3.6 million in the third quarter of 2022. Gross margin for the quarter was 19.45%, up 45 basis points from 19% in the same period in 2022. Our C&I segment accounted for approximately 67% of the quarter's revenues. Margin improvement reflected efficiencies generated through the consolidation of our teams leading to more efficient utilization of our labor despite the headwind from revenue mix.Year-to-date gross profit was 14.9 million, up 41% compared to 10.5 million during the same period in 2022. Year-to-date gross margin was 21.2%, up 40 basis points compared to 20.8% during the same period in 2022. Margin is expected to remain strong in 2023 as we continue to scale operations and drive efficiencies across segments. Although in any given quarter, revenue mix can cause variability in margin. As part of our ongoing strategy to expand gross margin each year, we will continue to implement synergies and efficiencies as we did this past quarter as our segment revenues grow. The operating loss in the third quarter was 1.8 million, a 3 million or 64% improvement compared to a loss of 4.9 million in 2022 third quarter, primarily reflecting the higher revenues and lower operating expenses as part of the company's focus on efficiency.Year-to-date operating income was a loss of 6.2 million, a 10 million or 62% reduction compared to a loss of 16.2 million during the same period in 2022. Non-cash depreciation and amortization expenses were 0.8 million in the third quarter of 2023, $1 million lower than $1.8 million in prior year period. Year-to-date non-cash depreciation and amortization expenses were $2.3 million, a $3 million reduction from $5.3 million in the same period in 2022. iSun reported a net loss $2.2 million or $0.07 per share in the third quarter of 2023 compared to a net loss of $4.9 million or $0.36 per share in the same period in 2022. Year-to-date net loss was $7.8 million or $0.35 per share compared to a net loss of $13.5 million or $0.98 per share in the same period in 2022.Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2023 was a loss of $0.5 million or $0.02 per share compared to a loss of $2.5 million or $0.18 per share in 2022's third quarter. Year-to-date adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $2.3 million or $0.10 per share compared to a loss of $5.9 million or $0.43 per share in the same period in 2022. We are continuing to focus our efforts on operational integration and creating systems and processes that allow for efficient and effective growth. In the third quarter of 2023, we reduced operating expenses by approximately $1.3 million or 15% in the same quarter of 2022, while increasing revenue by 47%. So far in 2023, we have reduced total operating expenses even while our revenues have increased by 39% by $5.6 million or 21%.We expect these positive trends to be sustained throughout the rest of 2023. Now turning to the balance sheet. Total debt decreased $4.2 million to $9.4 million as of September 30, 2023, down from $13.6 million at December 31, 2022, reflecting the ongoing repayment of our long-term debt. Our cash position of $5.5 million as of September 30, 2023 is the same as it was as of December 31, 2022. Higher revenues and diligent collections have benefited our cash position, although it has been slightly higher at different points this year, reflecting the large project volume currently in process. As we noted last quarter, we recognized the downward pressure on our valuation from our outstanding convertible note. Our strong operating performance so far this year enabled us to refinance our debt facility.We're delighted to have signed a term sheet for a non-dilutive $8 million term loan that is expected to close at the end of this month. A primary purpose will be to retire the convertible note as well as provide working capital funds. And with that, I will turn it back over to Jeff.Jeffrey Peck : Thank you, John. Let me reiterate how pleased I am with our performance this year. In the face of challenging macroeconomic factors, which have enabled us to continue to exceed the Street's consensus. The growth and strong execution in C&I last quarter offset the pressures we are experiencing in the residential segment, which demonstrates how our diversification is a true advantage. Our continuing ability to win new contract awards, both through our efforts and through our collaborations and partnerships ensures that we remain well positioned for success as we finish up 2023. Our team is laser focused on what they need to do to execute on the many different opportunities we have created within this continually evolving and dynamic energy market.In addition, we are benefiting from our focus on efficiency, which as John described has enabled us to reduce our operating costs significantly even while we are growing our top line even more substantially. All-in-all, we continue to execute on our strategy, supported by the investments that we have made to create recurring revenue opportunities as well as the positive impacts from the Inflation Reduction Act. We remain confident the best is yet to come for iSun and our stakeholders. I'll now turn it back over to the operator to open the lines for questions.
